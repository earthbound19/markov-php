I work with relations such as flatness/depth; part/whole; difference/repetition; static/dynamic; permanent/provisional, so as to enact a systematic, yet open and suggestive, treatment of pictorial space. At the root of my approach is a concern to broaden the scope of what is normally considered to be a purely formalist school of painting. Using pattern not only for its aesthetic, rhythmic qualities I wish to hint at its connections to informatics, by which I mean not only its cultural potential as semiotic content but also its socio-political ramifications vis a vis certain readings of techno-science, post-humanism and embodiment (e.g. Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Elizabeth Grosz, Rosi Braidotti). As well, I wish to implicate what I see as a promising overlap between the dynamics enabled by these constructs and those of various representations of 'natural' processes made by people working in such fields as self-organization, genetics and cognitive science. Intrigued by the limited means of the more minimalist branches of modernism, but discontent with their restricted ends, I want, in my work, to propose a multi-valent, non-determinist, deterritorialized space - a decentralized permutational network in which I picture contextually linked, multi-tasking, co-adaptive agents; adept at plugging-in to difference, constantly forming assemblages with the other, and ever open to the prospect of new becomings.

In my work I combine photography with textiles. I have always been drawn toward patterned surfaces, and particularly textiles in which pattern is inherent. Initially, it was simply visual pleasure that entranced me; years later, through study, I am impressed and fascinated by the language of pattern. It can identify a people, a region from which they come, as well as a person's age, profession and social status within a society. Using both patterns occurring in nature and from existing textiles, I create a language that informs the photographed subjects which are juxtaposed with backgrounds of pattern.

The photography is my own, with the exception of obvious historical sources. I have traveled extensively in Northern Thailand, the home of my husband's family. He is of the Karen hilltribe who reside along the Thai/Burmese (now Myanmar) border. My work features the people of this tribe and their neighbours primarily. I am interested in the idea of "The Other", whether it is my husband within my culture or myself within his. I try to explore issues of culture clash; including the subjugation of a people, condescending attitudes toward their beliefs and customs, and the appropriation and commercialization of "exotica" for western consumption.

For this web site I have included work mostly from four one-person shows; /Fighters and Lovers/, 1982, /Man Makes Himself/, 1985, /MOVE/, 1985 and /The 1997 Manitoba Flood/, 2002. I have also included small grouping of pieces from other shows.

The focus of what I have included reflects my involvement with the complexity regarding inter-personal relationships in our societies. In 1979 I accompanied my mother who had been asked to appear as a witness in a War Crimes Trial in Düsseldorf, Germany. After going through this experience with her my work over the next few years evolved into an exploration of anti-Semitism and Holocaust. How people inter-relate in our societies became focused on the Jewish experience as I saw it through my family's history.

/The Manitoba Flood/ work will on the surface appear to have a different subject altogether. However, in this body of work I have used the flood as a metaphor for destruction and its accompanying shot as a renewal. Each work is a diptych, one image was shot during the flood and the accompanying image of the same site was shot at some point after the flood. Together the photographs reflect the passage of time but more importantly how shifts in time and atmospheric space can bring transformation not even imagined before.

The artwork I have made is primarily and inextricably socially concerned.

‘museum piece’ (*a work in progress*) For a number of years my practice has focused on artifacts, collections, classification, and display. In some instances I have worked directly from museum collections: the Fortress of Louisbourg, The Nova Scotia Museum, and the Museo Archeologico Siracusa. On other occasions I have created my own collections and taxonomies.

My practice is an excavation of the detritus of everyday life. I borrow methodology from archaeology, anthropology, and natural history. Through an activity parallel to that of the museum, I collect, catalogue, and (re)present objects. I seek relationships between nature and culture, creation and production, what is lost and what is found. ‘museum piece’ combines several bodies of work in an on-going catalogue which samples the nature in our culture and the culture in our nature.

In /Zip-locks/, I collected an ‘artifact’ each day for one year from January 1 to December 31, 2000, and placed it with a tag in a zip-lock bag. The rules were the object had to cross my path on the day indicated on the tag and had to fit in the bag. The collection of 365 zip-locks documents the first year of the 21st century through material culture of the everyday. I spent part of that year in Italy where I began an accompanying series of small watercolours. /Italian Artifacts/ juxtaposes Etruscan artifacts, coats of arms, and flora and fauna with tiny collage elements from contemporary (tourist) culture. Some of these ‘artifacts’ ended up in the zip-lock bags.

/Artifacts from Pecos/ represents tools from a 10th century Pueblo village. Shaped and worn, these objects remain close to their natural formation. At once rock and hammer, bone and awl, they represent a fine line between nature and culture. In contrast to Pecos, I collect landfill fragments and aggregate (cement, rock, bricks, tiles). Made round and amorphous by the action of water, they appear as ‘city rocks’; culture mimics nature. I have a variety of shapes, colours, and sizes that depend on their combination to create classification. Worn bricks can look like 6thC BC loom weights or 21stC hot dogs, depending on their context. They are a simulacrum; they are relic and rubble.

In /Natural History Paintings/ I turn my attention to the natural world. Working from sources such as botany textbooks, /The Golden Book Encyclopedia/, /The Life Nature Library/, and /National Geographic/, I reconfigure knowledge based on empirical evidence. In this new order of things, associations are formed through visual perception. These paintings are meant to be pondered, much like naturalists would contemplate specimens in the field.

Summers are spent in Newfoundland collecting specimens. Like the naturalist, I comb the beaches and dig in the soil. Both places reveal bones, rocks, and detritus. The ‘artifacts’ I find, mostly rusty old tools, were used to harness horses, toil fields, and catch fish. I gather these objects and record their stories, accumulating an inventory of work and life. In Newfoundland, the small town museum is characteristic of remote outport villages intent on preserving their past. The locals rummage through their attics and ‘stores’ dusting off long-forgotten treasures for display in the museum. Glass cases are absent; items are displayed openly on walls and tables. There is little to read but lots to see, visual information superseding the written word. The small town museum provides a model for my own museological presentations. Drawings, paintings, and specimens are grouped together in loosely defined categories. Specimens and their representations sit in rows on tables and shelves, or pinned to the walls like bugs. It is a museum without labels, a book without words. January 2003

David Bolduc was our leading maker of poetic, lyrical colour abstract paintings and the inheritor of the mantle of modernism within the legacy of Jack Bush and Gershon Iskowitz. Bolduc, well-read and widely traveled, accumulated the lessons learned from a lifetime spent exploring the pleasures of the rich visual history of civilization. His works paid homage to his admiration for an inclusive array of places and traditions. His peripatetic wanderings took him to Paris, Spain, North Africa, Mexico, Turkey and the Middle East, China as well as clear across Canada. His art draws upon and celebrates our vibrant collective world artistic heritage: Persian miniatures, Oriental rugs African art, Asian calligraphy and the splendours of the inventive progressive art of the modern age.

He came to attention in the early seventies through his exhibitions at the prestigious Carmen Lamanna Gallery, Toronto. These works were taut, refined all-over monochrome compositions operating within the tradition of reductive, geometric abstraction utilizing homogenous treatments or a single mark-gesture repeated consistently across the entire surface. They were shown in the company of a band of minimalist-inclined painters: Brice Marsden, David Diao, Les Levine and Paterson Ewen. By mid 1970s, he and fellow Lamanna exhibition mate, Ewen were breaking free of this mould. Both had spent time studying at the school of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and their new work sprang forth with vivid colour and accentuated linear mark-making. Their works shown in the 1975 exhibition /The Canadian Canvas/ signaled the dawning of a new art. While Ewen gravitated towards New Image figuration and landscape, Bolduc evolved a unique signature approach to central imagery abstraction.

Bolduc's art re-asserted a strong figure-ground relationship of a hovering main motif articulated in bold impasto colours squeezed and drawn directly from the tube atop a stained background. Bolduc extended the modernist dialogue championed by Jack Bush, Robert Motherwell and Jules Olitski triumphantly showcased first by the David Mirvish Gallery and subsequently Klonaridis Gallery. In so doing, Bolduc became the locus of the evolution of a tendency strongly associated with a generation of Toronto painters referred to variously under the rubric: exotic or eccentric modernism. /Marcus Garvey/, (collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario), is reflective of a career-long obsession with colour, pattern and collage references. For all its modernity, its compositional form harkens to antiquarian appearances gleaned from time spent among libraries of rare, hand-stamped leather book covers and decorated bookplates. His sensitivity to this history prepared him to be the contributor of exquisite illustrations to a number of hand-made books and accompaniments to finely-crafted literary publications.

Bolduc openly embraced the joyous fauvistic colour of Matisse, Derain and Dufy. Like his kindred spirit, David Hockney, he relished the primacy and graphic play of free-hand drawing and acknowledged the benefits to be derived from constant daily work upon advancing his art: /Nulla Dies Sine Linea/. For four decades Bolduc nuanced every opportunity to evolve his characteristic style and formats. The temperament and tone of the works differed widely from stately, restrained and under-spoken neutrals to riotous exuberant gregarious colour symphonies sporting metallic and iridescent pigments. Quietly, behind the scenes, Bolduc, synonymous with abstraction, had begun again to sketch from nature: floral motifs, still-life, trees and stars. He and painter Alex Cameron commenced annual sketching trips across the country, notably recurring visits to the rocky coastlines and forests of Newfoundland. Organically, Bolduc's studio canvases embraced this admixture; his invented spaces would be refreshed by direct observation of revered places. David Milne, John Meredith, Paterson Ewen and John Clark come into play, so too the watercolours of Greg Curnoe. In an act of re-unification with glories of art's past, Bolduc created a number of moving, transcendent nocturnes redolent of Van Gogh's /Starry Night/. (with Lawren Harris's late abstractions not too far from sight).

In the seventies and eighties Bolduc was celebrated as a bright star in the constellation of Canadian art. He was a heralded exhibitor in Andrew Hudson's /14 Canadians/ that introduced progressive Canadian Art at the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington. He held annual solo exhibitions dating from the early seventies; his works are in the collections of public collections from coast to coast. Of late, many have turned their gaze away from the visual pleasures of formalism. Recently, Bolduc completed and mounted a final show for Christopher Cutts Gallery, Toronto. Confident mastery of his craft combines with a humble acceptance of his personal place within art's cosmos; the final show is a triumph of the personality as well as of the hand.

Dans ma pratique artistique, je m'intéresse à la manière dont nous percevons et construisons le réel en y projetant nos désirs, en transgressant la réalité par la fabrication de merveilleux par la psyché. Mon travail se nourrit principalement d'expériences subjectives en faisant référence aux espaces mentaux utopiques, aux paysages imaginaires, à l'idée d'exotisme, au désir amoureux, à la fantasmagorie, à l'errance onirique par exemple. À l'image des expériences d'illusions et de désillusions dont est parsemée l'existence, je cherche à produire dans mes œuvres une oscillation entre le plaisir de l'illusion esthétique et sa défaillance, entre une vision idéalisée et une banalité. Mon travail évoque la vulnérabilité humaine devant la précarité de ce que nous cherchons à circonscrire comme étant le réel, devant l'inévitable hiatus entre les désirs et la réalité.

Je réalise des installations de grandes dimensions, souvent éphémères et la plupart du temps in situ. Dans mes installations, le visiteur est invité à faire l'expérience d'un espace fantasmagorique bricolé, factice, ludique, où le banal cherche à devenir motif d'émerveillement. Des effets volontairement racoleurs de sons, de miroirs, de jeux de lumières colorées et d'ombres, de stroboscopes et autres plaisirs pour l'oeil magnifient divers matériaux de pacotille accumulés les uns sur les autres; toutefois, la précarité de l'assemblage, ou encore, le son ou l'éclairage devenu insupportable menace de réduire l'émerveillement en néant, tel un château de cartes. La figure du château, archétype d'une architecture "merveilleuse" dans l'imaginaire de mon enfance, est un motif récurrent dans mon travail, et plus particulièrement le château de cartes. Le château de cartes m'intéresse pour son architectonique mais aussi parce qu'il évoque deux sentiments contradictoires; celui de l'accès à un monde idéal et celui de la conscience d'un monde au bord de sa propre destruction.

Dans mes installations, je m'intéresse beaucoup à la manière dont l'œuvre est appréhendée physiquement par le spectateur pour interpeller son imaginaire. Je conçois des espaces parfois inacessibles, d'autres fois visibles seulement en partie, ou encore totalement submersifs. En effet, alors que dans certaines de mes installations (/Solipsisme/ et /Le jeu chinois/ par exemple) le visiteur s'engage dans un espace où il est submergé, dans d'autres installations il n'a accès à l'espace qu'en regardant de l'extérieur; par des hublots (/Je mens/), par le judas d'une porte qu'on ne peut ouvrir et en arrière de laquelle un son se laisse entendre (/Le bout du monde/), ou encore par l'embrasure d'une porte entrouverte (/Un château en Espagne et Encore des châteaux en Espagne/). Dans ces précédentes installations, tout n'est pas donné à voir et le visiteur est invité à avoir recours à son imagination pour appréhender l'œuvre. De manière encore plus radicale, le projet /My life without gravity/ consiste en un espace cubique fermé dont l'intérieur reste inacessible physiquement au visiteur. À l'intérieur de ce cube se trouvent des sons de feux d'artifice synchronisés à des lumières stroboscopiques, perçues à travers une constellation de trous percés à même les parois du cube. Une vidéo est projetée à proximité du cube. Sur celle-ci on me voit grimper une échelle et disparaître dans la fumée ainsi que tomber dans le vide, comme si mon corps cherchait à se projeter dans cet espace en négatif, de l'autre côté des parois du cube. /Château d'air/ est pour sa part un assemblage de seize portes noires toutes fermées, placées de manière à évoquer la forme d'un château ou d'une tour. Comme pour /My life without gravity/, on per¸oit des lumières stroboscopiques synchronisées à des sons de feux d'artifice à travers une constellation de trous, ici percés à même la surface des portes. Cet inaccessible château noir, magique et menaçant à la fois, n'est pas sans évoquer /Le château/ de Franz Kafka.

Conjointement à ma pratique installative, j'ai une pratique soutenue du dessin. À l'origine simples esquisses pour des installations futures, le dessin est devenu avec les années une pratique autonome qui se nourrit des mêmes préoccupations que ma pratique installative. Je réalise des dessins de grands formats qui évoquent des paysages imaginaires labyrintiques dans lesquels le regard est invité à se perdre. Comme dans Les villes invisibles de Italo Calvino où, dans une entente tacite entre le narrateur et le sultan, ce dernier se délecte d'une vision idéalisée de son empire, ces espaces irréels m'intéressent en ce qu'ils s'entichent d'une vision idéalisée du monde où le désir et la fabulation triomphent sur la réalité et la vraisemblance. Mes dessins sont composés de motifs s'amalgamant les uns sur les autres de manière à former des paysages artificiels où montagnes abruptes, tapis volants, cieux étoilés, volcans et châteaux deviennent des figures récurrentes.

In the practice of my art, I try to stage the way we perceive and build the "real" by casting our desires into it, how with our psyche we transgress reality through the fabrication of the marvellous. The core of my work rests principally on subjective experiences and refers to imaginary spaces, to the exotic, to romantic desires and to whimsical fancies. Like the experiences of illusions and disillusions strewn through our lives, my work strives to oscillate between the pleasure of the aesthetic illusion and its unavoidable breakdown, between an idealized vision and banality. My work recalls the vulnerability of humankind, faced with the inevitable discrepancy between our desires and reality.

My artistic practice takes shape in large dimension installations, often ephemeral, and, more often than not, achieved in situ. In my installations, the onlooker is invited to experience a phantasmagorical setting, self-tinkered, obviously contrived, highly recreational, where the commonplace leads to amazement. Deliberately chosen flashy effects of mirrors, of sounds, coloured lights, stroboscopes and other eye-catching devices magnify a bewildering array of bric-a-brac arrangements; however the precariousness of the structure, or else the unbearable play of the lighting reduce the awesome sight into oblivion, like a house of cards. The figure of the castle, the archetype of " marvellous " architecture of my childhood's imaginary longings, is a recurrent theme in my work, especially the "House of Cards" (which in French is called "ch�teau de cartes", literally "Card Castle"). The House of Cards interests me for its architectural structure but also because it evokes contradictory feelings: access to an ideal world and apprehension over its impending selfdestruction.

In my installations, I am interested in how the work is physically apprehended by the viewer to challenge his imagination. In /Solipsism/ and /The Chinese Game / Le jeu chinois/, the visitor enters a space where he is submerged whereas in other installations his only access is from the outside: through portholes (/I lie / Je mens/), through the peephole of a locked door (/The other side of the world / Le bout du monde/) or through a fixed doorway (/A Castle in Spain / Un château en Espagne/) and (/Castles in Spain again / Encore des châteaux en Espagne/). In these installations, everything is not for one's eyes to see and one must use one's imagination to comprehend the work. Even more radical, the project /My life without gravity/ consists of a closed cube whose interior remains physically unattainable. Within are the sounds of fireworks and strobe lighting seen through a constellation of holes in the cube's walls. Close to the cube, a video projects me, climbing a ladder and disappearing in smoke and falling in the void. /Château d'air / Air Castle/ on the other hand, is an assemblage of sixteen closed doors, placed in such a way as to suggest the form of a castle or a tower and which the visitor has no physical access. As in /My life without gravity/, one perceives stroboscopic lights synchronised with the sound of fireworks through a constellation of holes pierced on the surface of the doors. This inaccessible black castle, both magical and menacing, readily suggests Franz Kafka's Castle.

Along with my installations, I have a sustained drawing practice. At the beginning simple drafts for future installations, my drawing gradually became an autonomous practice nourished with the same preoccupations as those of my installations. I make large drawings suggesting imaginary labyrinth-like landscapes in which the gaze is invited to lose itself. As in Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities wherein a tacit understanding between the narrator and the sultan allows the latter to take delight in an idealized version of his empire, these unreal spaces interest me because they render an idealized vision of the world, where desire and fabulous inventions triumph over reality and verisimilitude. I realize my drawings by accumulating and juxtaposing motifs in order to create artificial landscapes or fantastic cities where steep mountains, flying carpets, starry skies, volcanoes, castles or exotic palaces for instance, become recurrent figures.

I was drowning. I was five. A sunny August day, sitting on a single rounded rock in mid stream. Who put me there? I can't swim. Sliding down the green slime into a wonder-ment of dazzling light and greens watching the last gasp of bubbles. My eldest daughter once said she wanted to go home although she was home. In Nova Scotia, I live surrounded by woods. My painting prac-tice for the last ten years has been about watery places. All I really want people to do is fall in and drown in the work. Perhaps, the need to find home. That's why I paint. Since 1975 my painted work has dealt with surface tensions between figuration and abstraction, geometry, and organicism in play with large elemental fields of colour, or black and white. The paintings from (1997-2000) utilized a variety of international signaling codes; such as marine signal flags, ground to air signals, and Morse code. In the past works, these spatial images portended to vast oceanic voyages, and dangerous crossings in a dialec-tical tension with the systemic pattern and codifica-tion of the signal props. The work in this exhibition are more elemental and evocative of particular creat-ed spaces and places.

I have been looking at space inside and outside and wondering why I can never see or detect space the way I perceive it in any depiction I perceive. Can space exist as a distinct entity? Can space exist outside a continuum of polarity? Can space exist as other than object and yet not be perceived as negative either quantitatively or qualitatively? Can space within space be shown? Can feminine space by virtue of its actual possession exert a vocabulary and perception imagined differently, that change ways of knowing? My intellectual interest is focused on the language and perception of space on a two dimensional plane; not illusion as in trompe l‚oeil, but as an entity in and of itself; space as force. *1* I question the vocabulary of painting, in particular, the term negative space. I suggest that extant vocabulary and therefore perception for these questions is obsolete. I also suggest that it is imperative to develop new ways of decribing what we see in order for perception to change and for understanding to evolve. Along with formal education both in Canada and New York, Freudian psychoanalysis, experience, and observation , informing my inquiry have been readings from Norman Bryson , in particular, Looking At The Overlooked, Four Essays On Still Life Painting, Sound and Symbol, by Victor Zuckerkandl, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard and writings of John Cage and Frank Stella.

My initial inquiry has propelled me through long and various experiments with different media (painting with blow torch on wood, etched wax, drawings on opened burlap bags, to name some) until constructing black velvet tarpaulins with painted extraction markings or space form abstractions, some with text as space and some with timed based projections. In a serious effort to articulate cerebrally, esthetically and viscerally the results of my investigations, and in effect demonstrate with the medium - the message, I will continue to research with the following elements:

Black Velvet: refers to both High (Megalographic-80‚s Schnabel paintings) and Low (rhopographic-roadside depictions of bull fights on domestic fabric) Art. Black velvet also possesses an inherent spatial quality.

Tarpaulin: as defined by the dictionary is canvas impregnated with tar, much as painting is impregnated with assumptive vocabulary.

Extraction Agent: is a liquid applied through the action of painting but does not impose in the same manner as paint. The action of painting with extraction fluid, extracts the pigment from the ground space and creates a form of space within the black velvet field. With this substance, an alchemical reaction occurs that turns the painted mark to gold so that something other than a positive / negative polarity occurs and something other than an object is created.

A space within space- space as something. Timed Based Projections: introduce an object as a temporal element to the Velvet Tarpaulin composition. The abstraction or text that has been painted with extraction fluid on the black velvet tarp depicts space within space existing on its own as the image. A timed slide projection of an object is periodically introduced to the composition for a set amount of time. The object, is temporal and can be seen in part as well as because of the spaces created. Adding the object as projection attempts to alter not invert a historical hierarchy of space/object relation.

The major theme in my work is the human condition -- our relationship to the environment -- our relationship to each other.

The works are a culmination of ideas, images and symbols that come together in an intuitive manner -- guided by a sense of rightness -- they belong together.

Each viewer, of course, brings to the work his or her own set of life experiences from which to access it. None of the works are totally readable -- they are open observations rather than closed statements. I hope that they continue to reveal new levels of meaning as new experiences are brought to them.

I feel that representational painting has much yet to offer -- if not in terms of how we paint then certainly in terms of why we paint.

There cannot be a more exciting tool with which to explore the most mysterious and fascinating subject known to mankind -- the human mind.

The central aim of my art practice is to demystify established cultural constructs by involving the viewer in the humorous debunking of idealized images, concepts and paradigms. I collect images from films, television programs, literature and popular music and transpose these images within a performance art setting, or distill them into installations wherein these components are manipulated, juxtaposed, contrasted and collided against each other, thereby eliciting a shift in perception and understanding.

My aim as an artist is to bridge the gap between the creator and the viewer, so that the viewer becomes a collaborator in the creation of the work. Ultimately, in my curatorial practice and in my art projects, I am interested in discovering and exploring new avenues for interpersonal interactions and engagement.

Death leaves its mark everywhere around the world. Rich people and poor people, criminals and outstanding citizens, celebrities and “nobodies” are equally affected by it. It is ruthless and final.

But what does death mean to us as a culture, and how do we deal with it? Growing up in El Salvador during the civil war in the late 70s, I was surrounded by death. There were corpses on the street on a daily basis. People that I knew intimately would be “disappeared,” killed or forced to leave the country in fear for their lives. However, though its spectre hung in the air like a bad stench, I did not fully realize what death was all about until one night, during the wake for a friend’s dead brother. Looking at the corpse in the open casket, I felt compelled to touch it, to connect with this person. I reached out and touched the corpse’s arm. The body, cold and stiff like a slab of meat, was no longer animated. It was an object, an empty shell.

When I arrived in Canada in the early 80s, the war in El Salvador was all over the news, and I became aware of another aspect of death, one that was sinister and scary. For even though death was in El Salvador for everyone to see, the Salvadoran media would never report on it. It merely carried on with its mundane procession of American sitcoms, cartoons, spaghetti westerns and commercials for toothpaste and laundry soap. To me, the images of war and carnage that I saw in the Canadian media were shocking. Strangely, the people around me were unaffected by it. Death had become yet another image to be processed along with millions of other images in advertisements, television shows and print media. This dichotomy fascinated me: the cold lifelessness of a corpse versus the culturally codified, abstract concept of death as seen in the media and popular culture.

Thinking about the aforementioned dichotomy between death as portrayed in the media and death as visceral, direct experience, I became aware that not even the real-time sensory experience of death, such as witnessing a murder, or stumbling upon a corpse on the street, could offer a true understanding of death. Death is an obscure, indiscernible reality. It is uncanny and cannot be completely (or at least satisfactorily) grasped.

We are flesh-and-blood sentient beings who have never been to “the other side.” What happens to our identity after death is open to debate, but there is one desire that unites the many differing camps: the need toexplain, understand and express our awe at the extinction of life, the end of all things, and to do the same regarding existence’s possible continuation in an afterlife.

In his essay for the 2006 exhibition /Six Feet Under / Autopsy of Our Relationship to the Dead/, Switzerland curator Bernhard Fibicher speaks of two ways in which contemporary art deals with the subject of death: One is to reclaim rituals concerning death (which have hitherto been the realm of religion and more recently been picked up by the funeral home industry and the media) and to reinterpret, recombine and restage these rituals using the idioms of contemporary art. The other approach is to bring the corpse back to the fore in order to shock the audience with a visceral representation of death. To these two tendencies, a third can be added: the humorous sublimation of death, wherein death is turned into subject matter for comedy.

The works presented in /DEATH... IT’S OUT THERE/ explore several aspects of death: death and violence, death and loss, death and popular culture, death and nihilism and what purportedly comes following death, the afterlife.

In the gun culture of the United States, firearms are seen as an aid to preserving life. Firearms protect people from their enemies. They are a form of self- defense and a natural right of every individual. This emphasis on self-preservation creates a state of fearful paranoia, which in turn leads to violence.

Representations of firearms are a major element in contemporary popular culture. War films, action films and westerns, for instance, would not exist if there were no firearms portrayed. A large percentage of TV programs feature guns prominently. Crime, war and law enforcement are major themes in literature and television, with firearms playing a role across all genres.

Zorica Vasic’s video /Shooting Range/ illustrates America’s fascination with guns and violence. Culling videos from Internet advertisements for shooting targets and rearranging them into an onslaught of brutality, the artist shows children and elderly ladies wielding powerful automatic weapons designed for armed combat. People shoot their guns sometimes with such excess that the whole affair takes on a surreal quality. In Vasic’s video, the shooting range target becomes a surrogate for the helpless victim of gun violence. The targets are sometimes static, sometimes motorized. As they are shot down, they slowly rise back up; once in place they are shot down again, creating a feedback loop of violence.

Faisal Anwar’s video /As Simple As That?/ deals with this issue of violence from a different perspective. The work was created post-9/11 in Pakistan at a time characterized by the artist as rife with global tension and strained Indian and Pakistani relations. Shot in the city of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, at a butcher’s home where people go to procure meat for their family meals, the video documents the killing of a baby goat and uses this killing as a metaphor for what we are doing to each other around the world. The title /As Simple As That? /refers to the fact that things are not so simple, and it directs the viewer not to take what they are about to see as mere sensationalism.

Using conventions borrowed from art house and horror cinema, Anwar creates an atmosphere of ominous foreboding through the use of stark black and white footage that has been shot in a hand-held style at varying speeds. This is accompanied by a sparse soundtrack composed of Buddhist chanting, drumming and haunting guitar melodies. The baby goat screams as it is held down, and when the butcher slits its throat the effect is shocking. The work is gruesome, eliciting strong reactions from viewers, but it raises the question: Why is this so shocking when it happens every day?

Mourning, the painful feeling that a person suffers at the loss of a loved one, is another theme addressed by contemporary art in relation to death. Juliana Schewe’s video /Still /surreptitiously captures the friends and family of the artist’s grandmother as they genuflect in front of the casket during her funeral.

The camera has been tucked away, hidden under a table. The coffin dominates the composition. The picture plane is presented as a symmetrical square that is surrounded by larger black vertical borders on either side, giving the composition a claustrophobic appearance, as if the moving image itself is contained within a box. Schewe manipulates the speed of the footage so that the movement of the mourners alternates between slow and regular motion. At times, the image stops in a freeze frame, perhaps as a way of pointing out the brevity of our time on earth. There are no young people in the video; the mourners are nearly all older. As the mourners move closer to the camera, their legs obscure the composition, and the viewer becomes aware of the intrusive nature of the video. None of the mourners know that they are being recorded, so the camera lens breaches a highly intimate and personal and vulnerable moment.

Greg Staats’ video /Wave/ presents the object of loss as an aural experience. Staats trains his camera at the frosted glass of his front door, videotaping shadows cast by tree branches outside his house. The result is a number of eerie forms that move like grey ghosts across the screen. An otherworldly soundtrack consisting of a funeral song performed in Mohawk by Staats’ grandfather, grandmother and uncles (all of whom had passed away long before the video was made) accompanies the image. The recording, made by Staats’ grandfather in the 1950s, was discovered by the artist posthumously. The harmonies are dissonant and lyrical at the same time. By combining the shadowy images with this song of faith and mourning, Staats alludes to the loss and remembrance of a simpler time, a way of life that will never return.

The theme of death is experiencing a renewed vogue in popular culture. Television shows like /Six Feet Under/ and /Dead Like Me /enjoy a great deal of popularity in the Americas as well as in Europe. /CSI/ and /The First 48/ are highly popular reality TV shows (the latter featuring real corpses and real police detectives) that follow detectives as they find corpses in abandoned lots or blood-drenched apartments and process clues to solve the crime.

The zombie, once a staple character in an obscure horror subgenre, has now become the stuff of modern urban folklore, in which scientific disaster is combined with religious scriptures of the rising of the dead in order to provide us with a contemporary vision of impending doom. The film /Shawn of the //Dead/ is a comedy in which the world is taken over by flesh-eating zombies.

Drawing on such sources, Emily Gove takes a humorous look at death and uses the idea of murder as a metaphor for competitiveness and treachery in female social interactions. Gove’s photographs draw inspiration from zombie films, pulp fiction novels and art history texts, combining these influences into a humorous and disturbing concoction wherein several characters are in the process of murdering one another. Whether the action takes place in a movie house, a construction site or an insurance office, the characters in the photographs are constantly engaged in the act of murder, with both victim and killer portrayed by the artist. The aspect ratio of the large-scale photographs is similar to that of wide-angle movies shot in Cinemascope. This is no accident, as Gove creates a film narrative that is told as a static image.

Gareth Brown-Jowett’s /Semi Automatic Clips/ addresses how Hollywood films glamorize war. The artist has taken clips from /Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, The Thin Red Line/ and /We Were Soldiers/. The artist recuts them, preserving only images of the natural beauty of locales in which these film battles took place; in other words, highlighting what Brown-Jowett calls “the beauty of war.” These images are combined with audio segments from battle scenes recorded at a reduced speed. The sound segments create an uncanny effect of anxiety, as if the fighting that one can hear in the distance will soon arrive and explode in full force like a tropical storm. Brown-Jowett asks, “If the director is attempting to create a realistic portrayal of war for the viewer, why have they chosen to include images of beauty?” It seems that the inclusion of these clips of natural beauty in Hollywood war films is merely a way to romanticize death and violence.

New York artist Joe Coleman views murder as a service to humanity, and serial killers as merciful individuals who fulfill the important role of ridding the world of overpopulation. He sees gun violence as service to the community and has celebrated murderers like Charles Manson, Ed Gain (the inspiration for Leatherface and Hannibal Lecter) and John Wayne Gayce in many of his paintings. In Coleman’s Malthus-inspired philosophy, this is not the time for birth, but a time for death.  “There is much hate right now in the world, because nature at this point wants to encourage warfare.” Nature wants humanity to exterminate itself, and those of us who murder others should be viewed as heroes, not pariahs.

Joe Coleman’s nihilistic view of murder as salve is echoed in Jubal Brown’s /Death Day Suit (with Self-Inflicted Wounds)./ However, where Coleman directs his destructive tendencies outwards towards humanity, Brown directs them at himself. The video was inspired by Lisa Steele’s seminal video /Birthday Suit/, in which the artist, nude, shows her many scars in front of the camera, and describes how they were acquired. Steele’s scars were the result of falls and accidents. Brown’s, in contrast, are self-inflicted.

Shot in the artist’s bedroom, the mise-en-scene of Brown’s video is dishevelled and menacing. A shotgun can be seen hanging from a nail on the wall. A white bed, reminiscent of the one in David Lynch’s/The Alphabet,/ provides a childlike eeriness. The words “Fuck You!?” are crudely written upon the grey-blue wall. The video’s aesthetic is dark and hopeless, like that of Jorg Buttgereit’s film /Der Todesking/, a cult masterpiece which blurs the line between art and exploitation, featuring one murder or suicide for every day of the week. Like Buttgereit’s film, Brown manages to be heartfelt and beautiful as he displays a large scar near his hand (“Left wrist, age 18, suicide practice”) or describes how an ash stain on his forehead was made by stabbing it with a cross made out of burnt church wood.

Central to our quest for meaning in death is the the possibility of an afterlife. What happens to us after we die? Do we go somewhere else? Do we retain our identity? Do we become nothingness, disconnected atoms and molecules that will be recombined to become other beings or elements? Do we reincarnate?

Su-Ying Lee purposely seeks to understand this reality. The death of her brother and the pressure of traditional Chinese culture to provide for her aging father instilled her with a great sense of guilt. Her video /Spiritualized/ features images of a decaying fish on a beach, covered in flies. As the camera closes in on the flies, a soothing, guided-relaxation- recording voice accompanied by a Tibetan prayer bell directs the viewer to “relax” and “let go” in order to achieve “mindfulness in sound.” The process of bodily degeneration is important to the artist, as she contemplates approaching old age, her own mortality and the deterioration of her own physical body.

Jack Burman’s photographs of corpses and bones inspire reverence and calm. His large-scale photograph/Capela Dos Ossos, Portugal /was taken inside a chapel made entirely from bones that were collected from graveyards in the 16th century. The image in the photograph is of an altar with a crucifixion image; the altar is made of human bones. Rather than appearing gruesome, the image is a beautiful reminder of the precariousness of life and the power of faith.

/Brazil #13/, shot at a Brazilian medical school, features the corpse of an elderly woman on an autopsy slab. The autopsy has already been performed, so the body is cut up in pieces that have been reassembled for the next class. In Burman’s hands, the cadaver acquires an air of quiet dignity, a regal equanimity. Burman photographs his cadavers after they have been carved by the scalpel, and always in a dignified, respectful manner. These images elicit feelings of attraction and repulsion, for in these cadavers we catch a glimpse of our own mortality.

Through representations of Hades and Valhalla, reincarnation, heaven, hell and purgatory, and in the rituals associated with mourning and loss, we use the vehicle of the arts to explore the undiscovered realm of death. From tribal burial rites to the infernal world of Dante; from the phantasmagoric creations of Henry Fuseli to Ingmar Bergman’s metaphysical cinema; from the musings of turn-of-the-century spiritualists to William Blake’s mysticism and the negations of materialist philosophers, the concept of death has played an integral role in the shaping of our identity as a people. As John Alan Schwartz, the writer-director of /Faces of Death /(an explicit cult film depicting various ways to die) puts it: “The only way to understand death and dying and the afterlife is to look at death right in the face.”  Although /Faces of Death/ is widely reputed to be more artifice than fact, Schwartz’s statement, nonetheless, touches on an important point: Try as we might, we cannot hide from death. The artists in this exhibition have not  only had the courage to find meaning in death through their work; they have been brave, or, perhaps, simply curious enough to look at death in the face... before it looks in theirs.

Figurative: This series made use of my long term love of drawing from the figure. I worked with the figure in a pop art style before evolving into a more expressive style where I could use my imagination. This painting is Bio-graphical, representing absence from a lover.

These landscapes were made to be decorative but taken from reality. Surface forms are flattened, using paint stains that soaked into the canvas. The colour is arbitrary. These painting were done after the death of my mother and so include skeletal forms. My feeling then was that all of life has an underlying layer of suffering and death.

The works are Abstractions wherein areas are composed of coloured lines with an expressive use of colour and form.

At the foot of Spadina Road in Toronto, sail boats were stored for winter with their hulls up on wooden cradles and covered with tarps. I used black and white photography to capture the forms as abstract compositions then rendered them in paint with arbitrary colour. Mixed media of canvas, wood, wire and string give them a semblance of the materials seen on the original site.

Interior images are abstracted using decorative textures. Using my personal space I drew on raw canvas with charcoal and paint and glazing medium. These represent a happy period and a love of architectural and interior design.

/Interior with Fig tree/ and /Tao is Back/ are about a period of time before I separated from my husband. I wanted to express the bleakness and sense of uncertainty that I felt through images of my interior spaces that I loved. These paintings have animated plants with sinister expression. Claustrophobic interiors in shades of black /greens, touches of violet, ochre and teal intend to have an expression is of tension, strength and stillness in the face of uncertainty.

After a period of turmoil and loss in my life I returned to painting using free association starting with a single mark. Fresh and fun, these images are born directly from the subconscious mind. There is also one mono print which also explores spontaneity.

The local oaks in High Park and trees seen when camping and hiking were my muse for four years. My goal was to eliminate the horizon line and focus on the textures of spaces between the tree trunks.

Moving into a method of painting with an emphasis on technique I began to explore the movement of my own hand. The origins of writing have always interested me so I began freely rendering my hand movements in automatist marks along registers or rows such as the Egyptians used. In some of these I combined the tree image with the marks. Gradually the marks took on a rhythm of their own in forming shapes in the paintings.

The automatist method using personal calligraphic strokes combined with my thoughts about various processes in nature led to a two year series. Motivated by my readings on nature I explored an automatist process which was structurally arranged on 'registers' such as in Egyptian pictographs and cuneiform writing only I invented my own calligraphy with the natural movement of my hand and a concept in mind. This approach to painting was spontaneous. This series led me into an exploration of the sea. Several years later I grouped the 'Tree' series, 'Phenomena of Nature', the 'Deep Sea' series and 'Earth' all under the heading of 'Earth Evidence:' and filed into categories of 'Creation',' Process' and 'Memory' which includes photography, painting and sculpture.

These works were initially inspired by Sylvia Earle's book /Sea Changes/ and then through further research on tectonic plates, mountains and creatures of the sea. The creatures of the deep sea, ocean mountain ranges and the process of bio-luminescence are the main concepts behind the images. The movement in these works reflect the experience I had when snorkelling on the great Caribbean reef of being pulled and pushed involuntarily by the power of the ocean. Technically these paintings have expanded in the use of a variety of applications using scrapers, poured paint and over lays on prepared textures. I love these paintings as they were a joy to make. I was submersed in their making.

The Earth Evidence series starts with various representations of detritus found in ocean tide pools, along streams, on beaches etc. gradually moving onto the escarpment as inspiration and as structure. My love of hiking in wild places of the world and here on the Bruce Trail fuel my imagination to make these images. Various translations of rock faces have been developed, some which adhere to nature while others merely mimic a loose grid of the forms found in rock layers. Gradually whispers of fossil like forms appear between the layers. Eventually the walls give way to my inventions of new hybrids. I am concerned with the collapse of species, such that the diversity of genetic lineages is lost to the future. New hybrids may form where possible after some panic of species to find mates from what ever is left after the collapse of eco-systems in the near future. These shapes have been inspired by the Burgess Shale found in Alberta which hold fossils of creatures that had evolved in an ancient ocean before animals walked on land. These did not continue to evolve. Some forms are plant like while others suggest primitive animals.

The digital images in this portfolio represent work done using original photographs by the artist and 'Photo Shop' imaging techniques. After traveling to places like Africa, Newfoundland, the Sea of Cortez in Mexico, California, Costa Rica and New Zealand, I was inspired by the natural history of creatures and the geological formation of land. Fossils found on land are the evidence of prior plants and creatures which once covered much of the earth. This skeletal/creature evidence was combined with photos of the places today to express a sense of the ancient natural world as it might exist in our imaginations when confronted with fossils.

Technically, I have tried to bring a "hand painted/drawn" look to this very technical process. The image has been worked extensively for expressive purposes rather than reality issues usually attached to photography. In some of the images a state of 'creation' has been attempted in 'animating' the image.

My full time studio practice includes clay sculpture and printmaking. The work derives from interest in the tension of strength against fragility and as I push the work towards the edge of physical collapse, this theme becomes more potent. The work is hand-built and sculptural in nature. The use of light interplay provides a perceived fragility explored through stacking and channeling of hand-built clay platelets.

The sculptures are often turned, tilted, built upon and re-fired, investigating the strength required for negotiating the relation between our interior and exterior worlds. Heaving, disrupted, uprooted forms hover in the space between the solid and the fluid, the fissure between order and chaos, of fluidity and brittleness.

Where previous series of Labyrinth and Laurel explored a body scale relationship based upon the vessel- pierced and layered, unable to contain more than light - this new work /Maelstrom/ and /Aggregate/ series, challenges my own approach and perceptions in moving away from the vessel, exploring disorder in a complex stacking of abstract passageways.

Working with clay influences the printmaking, encouraging a sculptural approach. The plates composed of stitched and reconstructed industrial roofing copper gives a second reading of strength and organic tracings embossed into the paper, reaffirming perceptions of fragility and transience.

Painting is my subject and all subsequent readings (including my own) are subjective and incidental. The titles offer an entry, but come after the act; that is, they are suggested in the looking and reflect an observation of the process followed, as well as the influence of books, music, people, the natural world and other art that may be attracting my attention at a given time.

Each painting has its own innate practical logic that develops through a series of yes-no decisions. I lay down a ground colour. Will it be opaque? Yes? No? OK, transparent in parts then. Yes. And then it's one mark at a time. And when I am truly in attendance (which is the state I strive for at all times) I load the brush and look for the mark on the canvas. There. And there. Not there. There. Yes. Yes. No. Each mark has a reason to be there.

While, clearly, intellect plays a significant role in the process, more important is my desire to embed an emotional code into the paintings. Through a subjective and intuitive process of trial and error I am developing a language built of marks that is, not surprisingly, very difficult to quantify in words.

Recently I have been re-investigating the notion of illusion in painting. In mathematics it would be referred to as the �Z' axis (if X is width and Y is height then Z is depth, the diagonal). Having painted without referential images for a number of years now, I have seen the work become flatter and more opaque. The empirical notion of the painting as an object first and foremost was the central condition. But this train of thought led to an endgame and I needed a way to break out beyond that.

Space, the next frontier (by no means the final), beckoned. I'm finding it's really a matter of not connecting the dots, at least not all of them. It's leaving space and creating the illusion of space through the use of line, transparency, layering. And what space is this exactly? Location is fluid in this work and disorientation common. But these paintings are where it's at. It is a state of mind.

Marks, dots congregate, congeal and the line forms, accretes, wanders and so I follow it. "...the refuge of the road..."1

Path Beginnings the open road ramble proceed pavane feet of clay stray dogleg dead end detour crooked mile thrawn skewed skewwhiff ford slip trace roundabout repeated circuitous well-trod retrace accretions burnished shining glory endless skeins of time

"every day I’m making ground..."2

You choose a path, arbitrary or perhaps the only one you’re presented with and you head out only to find yourself back at the beginning, circling, repeating steps, but as the path builds, if you are watching, you see beauty at every turn. Raised crossroads, the futility of the plan.

Blue for clarity (and yet it is almost completely opaque…) circuitry web tangle branch system; leave them all behind for heaven

"you, who are on the road, must have a code you can live by…"3

So I contain it in the square, with quicksilver paint that sets up as fast as you can put it down. "oh and I remember something you once told me, and I’ll be damned if it did not come true: twenty thousand roads that I went down down down and they all led me straight back home to you."

"Why would you want to do art about our experience. We're not important."

It's a comment we often hear from people. It not only speaks volumes about the nature of working and community life in our society but it also addresses how people see themselves and what the dominant culture has done to that perception. We work with unions and communities as part of a larger collective process to change those perceptions. Our working relationship is based on a collaborative process mediated through the union movement or community group.

Given the present social divisions of labour, our work attempts to bridge two audiences. Working people and those in the arts. We feel that it is not only important to articulate the concerns and experience of working and community life, but that it should also be able to stand up to the sophistication of corporate culture and take into account the complexities of cultural representation.

Initially, we developed a staged fictional format in our images to protect people from being identified by management. However, we soon realized that it allows us to push both the content and form much further. More recently, however, we have also developed a process of visual workshops in which community members collaborate in developing the form of the work and act in the final images.

Working with the union movement and communities has other implications. It begins to address the division of labour between wage work and creative work by demystifying the construction of each and pointing to similar social/economic constraints. It also begins to articulate a cultural politic around the democratization of access to cultural resources.

I used to think a lot. I thought the world was full of voices. I thought that things were events, information hurling itself down through time. I thought that separateness was the fundamental quality of things. I thought that anxiety, formerly distributed homogeneously through space, had congealed into lumps and rhythmic patterns, providing the soil for more sophisticated and implausible anxieties, the flowering of anxiety into sentient forms. I thought that places were separate but miraculously linked, and that space and time and pleasure had emerged somewhere in the tension that occurs between places. I thought that the subterranean quality of all things was random and content free. I thought about the fatal attraction of singularities, patterns and significances, that draw us inexorably, like a magnet, but always sidestep gracefully just when we’re about to gore them, because we don’t live in God but outside of Him. I thought, /So what? It doesn’t make my baby’s eyes bluer/.

I would go home early from a hot date for the voluptuous pleasure of thinking these things.

I think now I’ve forgotten how to think. I feel like a hollowed out libidinous shell.

I empathize with these swans. Fat flying snakes, meandering, labyrinthine momentum that has evolved a proud vertical architecture under the drag of gravity, and an appearance under the imperative gaze of others. These swans, in their proud maturity, are the hollowed out libidinous shells of a vanity, erect in the posture of pride and dignity. They are magnificent dinosaurs, monsters, heroic, tattered, ramshackle, bewildered and aghast. They are disbelieving and incredulous at the tide of ignorance and vanity rising in their wake. They are confronted by the cherubs – tender sensual particles, seed and fruit of the erotic body. They arch their feathers and rise to their full stature, doomed dignity confronted by the insolent self-assurance of the future. They are aghast before the naked cherubs, horrified at the vulgarity of youth, beauty and accomplishment. They are birdbrains. They are stunned, brainless, hollowed out erections addled by subtle termites, threatened and besieged, appearances betrayed by their own interiors, feathered shells out there on their own trying to make a go of it, wondering how many more times they will be obliged to unfold their arthritic peacock tails.

*An Overview: Ihor Holubizky* /Patisserie Duchamp: May I Smoke / Puis-je fumer/ is an installation by artist Christos Dikeakos. The subject matter is smoking, combining original works of art created by Dikeakos and in collaboration with others – drawing, photography and sculpture – with cultural artefacts and documents. The objective is neither to celebrate nor demonize, but to examine the broad social implications of a "habit" that has become a topic of foreboding and the forbidden. At the same time it would be myopic to pretend to erase smoking from history. The presentation follows a museological model, a visual text and planned accompanying publication that weaves together a social and cultural history and expressions through art and popular culture. But it is perhaps better described as a 'theatre of the museum' in which the topic is also a 'story of human behaviour and the human condition'. There must be a scholarly gravitas, yet achieved with humour and wit. Being able to laugh at ourselves is one way of learning. This subject has never been explored in this manner in a gallery or museum exhibition, and to follow, controversy should not be avoided because of timidity.

*An Outline: Christos Dikeakos* This exhibition proposal has been formulated from an ongoing work that dates from 1974/1994 – a body of work that was left in a time capsule, in storage, and the ideas and sketches of my unfinished Masters Thesis on the Large Glass by Marcel Duchamp – with another related work, /May I Smoke / Puis-je fumer/, which is also aligned to Duchamp and my preoccupation with cigar smoking as a working studio pastime/activity and pseudo addiction.

Smoking tobacco has played a role in art both as an inspiration and as a psychoactive mood altering substance since it took acceptance in 17th century Europe. In an unconscious way, an entire Western civilization used the devices of tobacco and coffee, which produced mind-altering shifts that registered in the workings and experiences of the brain. Needless to say the brain has for centuries relied on smoking as a craving and pleasure addiction. Cigar smoke especially since the early twentieth century was the air, which "stank" of the noteworthy company of artists' egos in public cafes and restaurants. Now in the twenty-first century, we are witnessing the end of tobacco as a psychoactive force; it is prohibited in public places, marking a /fin de siècle/. The title /May I Smoke / Puis-je fumer/, therefore is a grammatically potential optative with a less positive expression of the future or the present, requiring the permission of others, as it is no longer a desirable or imperative action.

I consider all this work, and my interest in Duchamp, as proto-conceptual and an important part of media and intellectual exploration. He unlike Matisse and Picasso became an important artist by abandoning painting. The counter tradition to painting for photography, collage and installation is what occurs for a younger generation of artists in the late 1960s in Vancouver.

Researching 1960s magazine interviews of Duchamp I came across a testimonial wherein Duchamp stated that he was more influenced by the writer Raymond Roussel (1877-1933) than modern painters. As an Art history student I noticed his literary and written approach – the ironies and meta ironies of language – was the work of an outsider, independent artist with an autonomous streak. And for most of his life, he had a studied disdain for, and avoided the artistic public. Art, for Duchamp, appeared to function at the service of the mind. He produced a body of distinct and unique aesthetic, which I have taken the liberty to rework, and indeed, Duchamp provided something of a license for others to do so. While visiting Lyon I noticed a shop named "Patisserie Duchamp". As a found sign and having the appearance of an epiphany I was reminded of Duchamp's miniature boxed editions of his canonic works, his /boîte en valise/. This edition could be considered as Duchamp's embellishments for sale at the time, at a reasonable price – delicious, mind provoking and eye catching, like patisserie. With Duchamp's passing I would then become the pâtissier, the pastry cook. This accidental encounter became the inspiration to complete my work many years later. The work is an edition of two of 20 photo collages in a clamshell folding box using the illustrations of /The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp/ by Arturo Schwarz as a source.

My interest and purpose was to continue the wit and further the play making of his work as an intimate and consecrated site of procedural inventiveness. I consider his work to be photo-conceptual, and by the late 1960s and early 1970s it was becoming evident that Marcel Duchamp could be considered as a precursor of conceptual art. In addition to the photo collages, I have included related works by or about Duchamp, magazines, editions, ephemera, photographic facsimiles/appropriations, books and correspondence.

With Duchamp's poem "Intramince" (published on the back cover of the 1945 /View/ magazine), tobacco smoke is rough going in but aromatic coming out and perfected when exhaled, a consummation married in the mouth as a mental and physical process. Smoke is also a way of inhaling and exhaling abstract and physical space (of dreams and oblivion) where the addiction/obsession of cigar smoke – from Duchamp, Philip Guston, to Frank Stella or the Mayan priests – produced a psycho awareness, a false state of lightness, and well-being. Smoking also participates in the circulation of desire and ideas.

Duchamp's interest in Eros and Thanatos, love and death is a theme that connects there two exhibition ideas. With "Patisserie Duchamp" I wish to present an exhibition that has the appearance of a Museum-like enterprise to engage, critique and parody. The idea of making work that accumulates and exceeds the display space of its container as museums do is evident in my "boîte en valise" Athens (1987-1996) and Vancouver (1991-1994) /Sites and Place Names/ projects. Likewise, /May I Smoke / Puis-je fumer/ is a body of work that includes charcoal and graphite drawings, photographs, wood sculptures, and installation work.

Postscript: quotes from Luis Bunuel in our present age of the prohibition of tobacco, cigarettes and cigars in public spaces:      – People smoke to celebrate a happy moment or to hide a bitter regret'      – Whether you are alone or with friends, it's a joy for all the senses."      – "He smoked until the dying hours of his life, ever faithful to the pleasure that killed him."

It must be emphasized that these ruminations on tobacco (and by extension and association alcohol) – the lure of the delicious – of abiding friendships and fertile reveries - must come with advice and a caveat, don't drink and don't smoke. It's bad for your health.

If you have driven through the streets of most suburbs, you have seen the row houses of equivalent design, decoration, and setback. Such standardization seems depressing to you, but the important thing is that it seems even more depressing to the suburbanite. As a consequence, an enormous amount of effort has been spent by suburbanites to make their homes different from those on either side and across the street. The more identical things are, the more he seeks some distinctive touch to symbolize and validate any particular tract house as his house.

Since 1998 my artwork has encompassed themes of sameness and lack of autonomy in consumer culture, typically viewed metaphorically through the subdivision vernacular.

In the series Home Invasion, for instance, the suburban subdivision is explored photographically. For this work, I made colour panoramic photographs documenting rows of nearly identical assembly line homes at various stages of construction in order to question the implications of uniformity and assimilative living practices.

In a later series of photographs, titled Natural Law, I examine the inherent futility of demarcating space: smoke stacks and tree branches vie for attention; a tree obscures a flashy Schneider’s meat billboard, and road kill on a freshly sodden grassy slope suggest that natural selection acts indiscriminately of artificially imposed boundaries. Despite extensive infrastructure, “maintenance free” materials, sturdy fencing, and billboards marking industrial progress, the principle of Natural Law exposes the irony of ownership, as the landscape inevitably surmounts artificially imposed perimeters.

In No Fixed Address and Paint Palettes, I examine how ornament and decoration are used to delineate space and assert autonomy. For No Fixed Address, I photographed the front doors and entrances of 25 subdivision homes on a suburban street in Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The structure of each home is strikingly similar in design, and each doorway is flanked by a set of nearly identical pillars. To offset the architectural sameness, many home owners have made a variety of superficial changes. Some front entrances have been renovated; others are replete with flower pots, elaborate entrance hardware, a wide range of concrete and flagstone steps, wreaths, seasonal ornaments and decorative mailboxes. Although the monotony of the 100 photographs is striking, the subtle “home improvements” become important signifiers of an attempt at demarcation.

Paint Palettes further explores the notion of the decorative, by parodying ordinary household paint colours and their exotic, grandiose paint names. Each piece is presented as an oversize paint sampler, depicting 65 identical garage doors sporting a variety of paint shades. The differences between shades is subtle, and at times hardly noticeable, yet the paint names differ radically, intimating that garage door paint can reflect a great deal about the lives of the home owners.

The series Open House extends the No Fixed Address and Paint Palette series into the interior realm, by examining domestic suburban interior spaces. Although each interior differs more radically than the exteriors might suggest, it becomes apparent that the changes made to each space rely heavily on decoration and ornament. Thus all three bodies of work suggest an irony: How is it possible for a person’s sense of autonomy and place to be described through mock-classical imitations, pastiche, paint, or ornaments that are themselves mass-produced, heavily marketed substitutes for true artisan practices?

Last year I made a series of thirty-two drawings called /Notations/ that is an investigation of my levels of consciousness in the process of drawing. My objective was twofold: to explore the psychology of consciousness in drawing and to investigate contemporary print technologies by transforming the drawings into digital prints.

On one level, /Notations/ is an drawing as an immediate and subconscious process. My past research has included and indepth study of the immediacy of painting in the work of Philip Guston during his last decade where he often completed a painting in one night. The images in /Notations/ are a compilation of drawings that I made while talking on the phone, usually about school business. I chose my phone "/Notations/" as a subject for prints because I consider them a subconscious aspect of my drawing.

The 32 gestural black ink paintings in /Notations/ are all on the same ground, a notepad reproduction of one Monet water lily painting. The reproductive dot pattern of Monet’s image contrasts to the spontaneous ink painting in /Notations/. I purposefully chose Monet’s water lilies as a ground because I believe that his later, large-scale garden paintings are an important reference for contemporary abstraction and immediacy in painting. Both Eastern and Western art history have a vast and important trace of large- scale gestural painting. Although there is a precedent in Renaissance painting for large- scale work, Monet is the first Modernist to create 42’ stretched canvases. Monet’s large water lilies were meant to engulf the viewer in the detail and power of nature, like /Notations/, thirty-two large format prints effect scale in juxtaposition to the intimacy and gesture of their handmade marks.

/Notations/ is also about the cultural, philosophical and psychological bias revealed in the immediacy of drawing. While working on /Notations/, I was researching African Kuba cloth. They are beautiful textiles that reveal as much about African culture as they do about the provocative and arbitrary choices of the marker. The implied mathematical structures of weaving are secondary to the Kuba artist’s aesthetic innovations in pattern. When the maker’s of Kuba cloth divert from predictable patterns they reveal and immediacy in weaving. The images in /Notations/ are square in homage to the square Kuba cloths that I studied.

The relation between participants and the event is the starting point for my investigation into the production of knowledge, the status of the physical body, technology and apparatuses of power. I incorporate various media including video, networked webcams, interactive websites, sound installation, text and performative strategies to design participatory events and actions. Often, the work is collaboratory, and created through a network and team of artists, computer programmers, technicians, event coordinators, and various invited and incidental participants. This network and mode of creation is as integral to the form and content of work, as is the media format used to deliver the event.

In the contemporary climate of specialization and high tech spectacle, the work I facilitate and design highlights notions of technological failure, human and electronic fragility, and the marginalized status of the physical body. The work is often exploratory and critical of ubiquitous biotechnological systems, notions of "interactivity", and network systems (socio-political and technological) as they circulate within artistic, scientific, social and cultural architectures of knowledge and modes of production. The intention is often to illuminate and re-examine the unspoken and codified social protocol, social contracts, and voices of control and agency implicit in the use, access to, and design of these technologies.

My recent paintings have led me to believe in the codification of colour: painting revealing a measure of its own objectness; the very mystery of it being. The painting takes something from the artist and in turn has its own presence.

I like to think of the colour as being /in/ the paintings not on the surface, like tattoos.

Colour also functions as a factual component. One colour is equal in importance to the other. Colour is chosen intuitively by weight and presence and not necessarily by its coded, commercial, or representational properties. Mapping the colour to give the paintings its own oneness. Making clear the colour's intentions.

Recent paintings have led me to believe in the metaphysical possibilities of my art­ a painting revealing a measure of its own objectecness­ the very mystery of just being there.

In these new paintings I borrow shapes from my environment and displace them. The shapes in turn have a presence all their own. More of a physical than an imaginary reference.

Rather than thinking of my colours as being on surface of the painting, I prefer to think of colour as /in/ the painting: like tattooing the colour into the surface.

In my work, colour functions as a factual component, one hue being equal in importance to any other hue. Colour is chosen intuitively by weight and by presence, not necessarily by its representational properties, commercial or natural.

Can a painting be a substitute for a "real thing" that arouses emotions? A cloudless view: the mirror and the other.

Ric: Malevich never painted a true square in his whole life. R: It was the idea of a square. Ric: I measure things out. The propositions arise out of consistency with my personality... I think I've come to measure as a matter habit.

    Interview with Ric Evans by Robert Bowers, "Ric Evans, Mercer Union,     Nov 23­Dec 11, 1983", Vanguard (Spring, 1984).

Evans seems to be using the more purely formalist geometry of his earlier paintings to create semi-recognizable signs that refer beyond the physicality of the canvas to the specific forms of nature, affirming in the process the tacit, formalist belief that visible phenomena are structured according to absolute, universal laws. Andrew Schulz, "Ric Evans at the Grunwald Gallery", C Magazine, (Winter 1987).

Common to all of the new paintings is their exaggerated sense of doubleness, twoness, of the residual symmetry that appears to have existed once and then been dislocated, perhaps the function of the renegade action of the painter's taste upon the givens of geometry. Gary Micheal Dault, "Focus on Ric Evans", Canadian Art (Spring 1989).

Whatever the theoretical presuppositions Evans brings to his practice, the methodological constraints he imposes upon it, or the perceptual and arithmetical rationale he uses in making paintings, the fact remains that his final concern is with the observer approaching the painting simply as an object: a peculiarly loaded object to be sure, but an object nonetheless, and one that yields its secrets only in our experiencing of it.

While the 'attitude' towards the empirical here is difficult to identify in formal terms, integral to Evan's best painting is what we might well term an 'existential' claim...that is based on, and implicit in, and empirical methodology and an intuitive ethic...to descend into the world of our concrete, lived experiences, which means returning to our experiences in a pre-objective world. Evan's painting language may be said to equate with a sort of "descensional reflection."

L.G.: So what do you want the outcome to be with the viewer? R.E.: I want the viewer to watch the aura that I'm giving off with the work: the sense of order, the sense of beauty in painting, the colour, the history. And to ask questions. Why is someone doing this? What is there for me to see? It's like when you meet someone you find interesting and you ask questions about them very carefully, then you start getting close to them...the work.

The self, terrible and constant, is for me the subject matter of painting.

Art should raise questions. The true artist helps the world by revealing mystic truths.

Desire often results from understanding the process. Understanding may be gained through observation of existing chains. The critical opinion provides opportunity for observation of a secondary link.

My experience as a printmaker made it a logical step to combine the actual techniques of paper marbling with watercolour. The majority of my smaller works on paper were made using this method. The figure in each piece, orchid or frog was drawn in the paper and then protected by a stencil. Paints were then manipulated on the surface of a viscous fluid, and then transferred by contact to the paper. Later, the stencil was removed and the rest of the image painted in.

In choosing the colour of the paper and the colours of the various paints, the final image was always held strongly in mind. The simplest marbling technique, 'stone patterning' seemed most appropriate for the poison arrow frogs in works like /Camouflage/ or /Rainforest Floor/. These circular globules of colour suggest stones, or microscopic cells, and interact vibrantly with the variegated skins of the amphibians. The turtle in /Fragments of Debris/ is an exact re-creation of the turtle in waves, allowing for an assessment of the similarities and differences in the two ways, arriving at an image.

The orchid paintings use a variety of manipulations to achieve their effects. In /Turbulence/, /Flaming Gold/, and /Big Orchid/, a stylus was inserted into the stone patterns to create very individual images. /Chaotic Green/ made use of a small 'afro comb'. Both /Floating Pink/ and /Standing Waves/ were arrived at by use of traditional marbling combs. All of these works combine controlled rendering of the 'main' subject with the organic, fluid process of paper marbling, wherein there is limited control, not unlike the act of gardening described above.

It was in the drypoint, /Flowers From J/, that the idea of an exhibition based on flowers and gardens had its inception. The print was originally a spontaneous response to a bunch of flowers sent by a family member, but the possibility of colour variations intrigued me, so I photographed them for later reference. /Red & White/ and /The Copper Wall/ are two of these variations. The oil painting, /Afternoon Flowers/ is another view of this subject.

Monotype is a medium that remains unfamiliar to many people as a form of visual expression. Simply put, a monotype is a unique impression painted directly on a non-porous surface, such as glass or a metal plate, and then transferred to paper by use of a printing press. Because the working surface is smooth and non-absorbent, paint can be laid down, wiped away or added, smudged or smeared using anything at hand -- roller, brush, rag, Q-tip, even fingers -- until the decision is made to print. One of the beauties of this method is that it freely incorporates the immediacy of drawing and making marks with tones and washes usually associated with watercolour, as well as the possibility of building up a more opaque colour as in oil painting or gouache.

Unlike other printing techniques that can yield numerous copies of a single image, a monotype, as the name suggests, is one of a kind. After a monotype is committed to paper, a ghost image remains on the plate; a /cognate/ that can establish the starting ground for reworking the image in a second monotype and so on. The plate must necessarily be worked on quickly, while the paint is wet, and often more than a single monotype is produced at one sitting. A canvas arrives, over time, at a final resolution; a series of monotypes, on the other hand, can chart various stages of the painting process. This appeals to the modern sensibility that is concerned as much with the journey as the destination.

Although Rembrandt was one of the first artists to add tone by directly applying ink to some of his etching plates, it was Degas, at the end of the nineteenth century, who produced the first body of work in this medium. Since Degas, many artists* have made this method part of their working repertoire; but it is not until recently that the medium has been accorded the critical respect that it deserves.

  	/WINDOWS ON THE WATER/   	       "It is like trying to paint a soul."   	          -- Ruskin, "Of Truth of Water"

Perched above water in my studio, I look out each day at the mirror of Nature, the changing faces of weather and light, and of human works, the endless bustle of industry and traffic across the canal. No wonder that, traveling, I've been drawn most to those places where the great harbour cities open a space for the wild waters of rivers and seas, and civilize them, -- Singelgracht Canal, Rio delle Canaica, my Lachine Canal. When you've painted the waters long enough, they seep into everything: the studio floor, the still-life table, the palette of paints. You come in closer touch, too, with the Claude, Courbet and Kokoschka. The difficulties of the subject are great, but on the other hand, it's so wonderfully apt for the medium we use, fluid and willful, while pleased to offer reflection, translucency and movement.

The images are a survey of various aspects of the artist's work since 1975. As the objects are often reused in different combinations in different situations, they are untitled and undated. In most cases they can be hung on walls, placed on floors, or suspended from ceilings. The objectivity is emphasized by the subjectivity of placement; intention and chance in a continuing of space/time. Materials include acrylic, oil paint, ink, canvas, rayon, steel links and clamps, steel, wood and plexiglass.

For the past two years I have been developing a photographic portfolio which examines the contexts I find myself in as an artist: the studio, the art school, the museum, the international biennial. I am interested in all the situations in which art is found, both in its production phase and as a finished object.

I am also keen to draw out correlations between those conditions of artistic production and consumption and the chaos of everyday life in process — in the street, on a construction site or in the domestic realm. Humans are hard-wired to manipulate materiality: We are devoted to constructing, acquiring, rearranging, deconstructing, recycling and disposing of stuff. Art is as much a byproduct of such urges — the urges that shape our entire material culture — as it is an elevated, freestanding activity. Photography now strikes me as the most direct way to talk about these relationships.

I'd like to think of my new work as documenting the art world at a time when it is has reached a peak in its production of sheer materiality, with its crowded art schools and overflowing biennials, art fairs and hedge-fund collections.

The bearish art market of the 1980s, so critiqued in the art theory of the 90s, has returned, more post-ideological, ahistorical and polyglot than ever. Despite the legacy of conceptualism, institutional critique and the anti-object, even the most radical gesture can now be co-opted, finding its way to a life as a material, archived, commodified object. It is difficult not to see the materialism and lack of direction in the art world as paralleling the crisis of what we call the "real" world, with its imperiled environment and world-wide energy shortages, and the frightening political ramifications of both.

Of all the structures of contemporary art, the least recognized and documented is the space of the art school studio, where much of contemporary art has its origins. The chaos in the studio reflects a desire for unstructured play that seems to operate as the flipside to what is seen as the regimentation of a non-artistic life. Yet it is only by structuring their "play" to suit the regimentations of the biennale, the gallery system and granting structures that students can hope to make their way. Student detritus reveals how quickly they absorb the zeitgeist of current art production.

In my photographs, I hope to explore the modes of consumption common to art and the everyday, as art makers and our art-trained eyes transform refuse into something it was not meant to be.

An overriding preoccupation in my work has been a growing doubt that painting can have contemporary relevance. Although it might be important to deconstruct and understand the art of the past from a contemporary perspective, my practice was striking me as increasingly academic. The current boom in the art market, and painting's resurgence in popularity (very similar to that of the early 1980s) only confirms that painting still feeds a populist notion of expressivity and individualism bound up in the authentic, unique object. So much for deconstructionist tactics.

With my painting practice seeming in jeopardy, I undertook to paint one more large project, with the conscious idea that it would be my last. "Last Pony", based on "Whistlejacket" by George Stubbs (c. 1762), is a reprise of earlier work of mine that dealt with the equestrian portrait and an analysis of the hero. Stubbs, at the request of his original patron, had left the background blank. Into that void I inserted the landscape from an earlier equestrian painting by Velasquez, his "Phillip IV on Horseback" (c. 1634). The Spanish monarch's reign had striking similarities to the second Bush administration. Riderless, the horse is about to plunge into the unknown landscape. The figure represents either the epitome of autonomous freedom or a fearful flight. While this project was in process, and despite the shattering of my belief systems as an artist, it became a point of pride that the painting be technically accomplished. The achievement of that goal would be a therapeutic act, as anachronistic as I was beginning to feel an allegorical painting might be.

For the completion of my "Last Pony" project, I started working with a photograph of the painting just as it was being finished in the studio, standing on paint buckets on the floor. Examining that image in a digital program, I could see the wide array of colour schemes I could have used for the original painting. The computer, that is, provided options — "colourways" to use a term from commercial textile production — that were almost unavailable in a traditional studio.

A previous painting project, "Sliding Landscapes", had tried to address some of these same issues. It investigated painting as d�cor, purposefully taking a small range of historical images (18th-century Italian landscapes), reworking them in several modernist colour schemes and then hanging the works as a pattern on the wall, like an Ellsworth Kelly installation. With "Last Pony", I might once have considered doggedly realizing similar colouristic options as a series of painted variations (see Gilles project). Now, however, with the image conceived as a manipulable photograph of an object in context, I am relieved of that fetishistic studio imperative.

This project sampled the genre of the Italian Capriccio (invented landscape). These historical sources are cropped into elliptical canvases, and then tipped, as an attempt to show how strong the viewer's need is to orient to horizontals, or verticals, even in so called nature.

The eight paintings are installed at varying angles and heights, animating the whole of the wall. As monochromes they evoke the Ellsworth Kelly installation at the National Gallery in Washington, DC, "Color Panels for a Large Wall" (c.1978). However, their diagonal composition denies the flatness of that modernist grid. The landscapes themselves recall motifs found in wallpaper or brocade, suggesting that the solemnity of the monochrome might be the decorative in disguise.

When I started this project I was teaching a painting seminar about the Death of Painting.

In 1994 I went to France and saw sixteen versions of Claude Monet's "Rouen Cathedral" at the Mus�e des Beaux Arts in Rouen, a series he did in 1892 – 93, a hundred years earlier. I also encountered my first Yves Klein blue monochrome painting at the Centre Pompidou, which had been painted in 1960. On a previous trip to Paris I had fallen in love with Jean-Antoine Watteau's "Gilles" at the Louvre, finished in 1720, which may have served as a shop sign for a cafe.

In my research on Yves Klein, I was taken up by his persona of the Dandy; he'd moved the legacy of Beau Brummel to the 20th Century. I was quite envious of the younger male painters in my milieu who seemed able to take up abstract painting without a qualm. Dandies themselves, they smartly took up a critique of the monochrome, weaving in references to pop culture, while making attractive, decorative work. They got to have their cake and eat it too. I'd trained as a formalist fifteen years earlier, but in the heady 80's had eschewed a conservative practice that didn't take up the political. Ever the whiney feminist, somehow I'd missed the boat.

This series was an attempt to reconcile all that. The seriality of Monet's project connected to the seriality of Yves Klein's. Yves Klein's performative figure seemed to connect to Gilles, the consumptive clown/artist. Both died young. Although known for his blue paintings, Yves Klein dealt with all the primaries. His paintings were a reiteration of Rodchenko's red yellow and blue monochromes, which in 1921 declared the death of painting. The first time this sentiment may have been uttered was in 1839, when the French painter Paul Delaroche was asked to prepare a committee report on the invention of the Daguerreotype to the French government.

With this work I hoped to make more complex what seemed to me a certain feminist polemic in my earlier work.

The paintings that I have shown most often are cover versions of some of the top hits in the canon of art history, examining stereotypes of the human figure as it has manifested as nudes, warriors, clowns, and artists.

One series, "The Complete Artist", examined the history of the image of the Artist, appropriating portraits for their embodiment of certain stereotypes: the artist as angry, serious, bitter, modest, juvenile etc. Together they seemed to comprise a group portrait of my artistic milieu.

Another series, "Artist's World", tried to envision the Artist of the future, using depictions of children whose genders, although implied by their clothing, could be interchangeable.

Having just finished my MFA, I decided that I had to either quit painting or learn how to paint all over again. I was teaching in an art school, trying to figure out why people were so insistent on painting from the nude model. This work was an attempt to take apart historical notions of the female nude and its opposite, the armored warrior.

As a newly minted Lacanian feminist, I hoped that I was reclaiming both subject positions; on one hand I was trying to invest the female nude with erotic potential that might be more complex, and on the other I was trying to inhabit the role of the male protagonist.

/Synopsis of Works/

My work is a means of creating connections between political or social issues and the viewer. I am interested in the evocative potential of the narrative aspects of an issue and in opportunities to transform. My subject matter is often rooted in the specific concerns of the communities I live in. In the past I have utilized an analytical presentation of the facts. /Within Between/ (1988) explored the immigrant's state of living between countries. /But, what does feminism mean to us now?/ (1991-92) investigated feminism's status at a specific moment in time for a given community. /America Searches for Content: the L.A. Times Screen/ (1991) revealed the narrative structures underlying our reading of the local daily news, and /Scenic Sites/ (1996-97) examined the unacknowledged injustice of WW1 Canadian internment camps. In each of these works it was my intention to make the invisible narrative facts visible using diverse media: printmaking, bookworks, billboards, performance, community-interactive installations. My current work is based primarily in multimedia installation art and remains research-based, experiential and community-oriented. /Spinning on Uncertain Ground/ (2000) used a town in the Central Valley as a microcosm of the world, exploring the invisible forces of time and place that shape our individual and collective realities. A new focus for me in this work now is in creating /spaces for environments/ in which the viewer is aware of his or her own sensory responses to the issues, approaching these from the intuitive knowledge of the body rather than from the rational.

Towards this end I have been investigating new ways of thinking about how I integrate the evocative and narrative aspects of my work, moving toward a more abstract representation of social issues. At the Glenbow Museum archives in Calgary I was invited to research cultural artifacts for their ongoing contemporary exhibition series entitled /Connections to Collections/. An ongoing theme in my work is the burden of history and memory on present consciousness and creating opportunities for its transformation. Utilizing /burden baskets/ from the Glenbow collection in combination with hand-blown glass, audio and other elements, I was able to create a rich sensory environment, resonating in history and individual memory, in which the various elements resounded together in an experiential way for viewers. This installation, /Release/, was also recreated in a second version for the Medicine Hat Museum and Art Gallery using baskets and other European artifacts from their collection.

In my research with large groups of people, /The Burden Work/ (1993-96) I came to realize the many 'burdens' we carry are both deeply personal and collectively global simultaneously. To create a space of resonance in which cultural burdens, history, memory and other personal baggage can vibrate side by side is to me an opportunity to create a doorway into another realm of thinking about these things, one that is experienced viscerally before it is understood rationally. I want to continue to create work in which the synthesis of these elements happens in the viewer rather than at a distance in the art objects mounted on the walls.

Have you ever had one of those moments of absolute clarity - where self, landscape, and context instantly fuse into coherent understanding, and history's continuum opens out before you like a long, deep gorge? This work comes from such a moment.

In 1914, the Government of Canada first used the War Measures Act to unjustly intern 8,579 immigrant Canadians in 24 camps, one of which existed in Banff at the foot of Castle Mountain in summer and at the Cave and Basin Hot Springs in winter. Over 600 internees occupied the Castle Mountain/Banff camp between 1915 and 1917. The reasons for the camps were largely economic. Parks Canada wanted roads built to develop Banff's tourism frontier. Internees provided cheap labour at a time when Canada was at war in Europe. Parks Commissioner J. 'Bunny' Harkin devised a plan calculating the value of mountain scenery at $13.88 per acre, resalable many times. To develop Park lands for tourism, Canada needed paved roads to bring in new American cars. Internees built the Banff-Lake Louise highway, trails around Emerald Lake, roads and sidewalks in Banff, bridges, and more.

The imprisoned men were poor, mostly Eastern European immigrants carrying Austro-Hungarian citizenship, having emigrated from countries then under Austro-Hungarian rule. Many were already naturalized Canadian citizens and their sons, born on Canadian soil. They were not enemies of Allied forces. The largest group interned were Ukrainians who, 30 years earlier, were encouraged to immigrate by the same government because they were hard-working and superb farmers. Though surrounded by beauty, the internees lived under miserable conditions.

The site at the foot of Castle Mountain still bears traces of this story. It was there that I promised my ancestors to bring the realm of the invisible into the visible, rather than allowing the painful to be paved over by history. On the streets of Banff everyone is on holidays, traveling the scenic routes in their cars, creating bear jams. No one sees the barbed wire lying in the grass like so many thorns in a wild rose bush. This work is part of a larger installation and performance.

In the studio the painting is an ambiguous poetic terrain – a field of endless possibilities. During painting earlier passions and preoccupations surface and recede, leading to new insights into the language of painting. Painting is an act of contemplation or meditation; images, like words, invite us to think silently.

Slowly beyond the interaction of materials, inner patterns of meaning are revealed. More questions, more possibilities arise. On a good day you discover a new continent.

The evolution of memory into the imaginary and the re-invented is at the center of the paintings and installations of recent years. Complex surfaces hold images and texts, changed as if seen through layers of time. Perforated, fragmented, stitched papers and fabric, beeswax, oil and pigments are transformed into visual terrains of remembrance.

For the past three years, Katja Jacobs has been exploring images and memories from her past, using them as a point of departure for what I regard as some of her most provocative and engaging work to date. The project began as a series works on paper, but now includes a number canvases. Jacobs incorporates specific images of places and people crucial to her history, transforming them and often concealing them with layers of "text" that blur the distinction between drawing and writing. At times, we can read phrases, words, fragments of sentences, while at others, known alphabets and language dissolve into graphic abstraction. The series employs literal collage, as well as visual palimpsest, with layers often stitched together to create yet another kind of intensely physical "drawing." This powerful physically is further expressed by the rich variety of materials, from graphite and paper to cloth and wax, used to suggest surfaces transformed by the passage of time.

In these works, Jacobs explores themes of memory, loss, distance, and displacement; she probes notions of language, dislocation, and retrieval. These are issues relevant to anyone aware of the passage of time and to anyone concerned with the particulars of personal identity, but they have special resonance for anyone whose life has been disrupted by change and relocation – experiences common to many Canadians, these days. That these themes are filtered through a female consciousness makes them, in my view, all the more arresting.

The post-modern world is a godless world. Humanity has become morally superior to God. God has punished his most faithful, Job, and let his son, Jesus, be brutally sacrificed, leading to the lament, "If there is a God, why is there such suffering in the world?" If God is omnipresent, then he knew that Eve would give Adam the apple and all of the subsequent suffering and punishment was essentially a set-up job by a sadistic psychopath. Of course this modern realization has more to do with the development of humanity's psyche than a free floating phantasm, surveying and manipulating our destiny. We are left alone with the human calamities of war, starvation and racial and economic slavery. We are solely responsible for the collapsing ecology and potential annihilation resulting from a nuclear accident or war. We are left with the existential realization, "What you see is what you get. If we fuck it up, we're fucked!"

Most of my work over the past ten years has dealt with the spiritual desolation of the post-modern psyche. We no longer have hope that science and technology will replace God, saving us from all ills as we did at the beginning of the 20th century. Many of us now see the ignorant misuse of our technology as the direct cause of our present global peril. My //Madonna// Series, (1979-1983), depicts the new God as Technology, and the new Mary impregnated by the mass-media, often depicted as a TV monitor, as in "The Technological Rape of the Virgin". My /Angel/ Series, (1982-1984), narrated the disembodiment of the Human Spirit, using the archaic symbol of the Angel to represent humanity's link with a higher spiritual awareness, being ignored in various familiar contemporary settings such as "Angel in the Rivoli". The /Rachel/ Series, (1984), showed a resignation to the inevitable corruption of the individual in contemporary Western society. Rachel is relentlessly pursued by animate and inanimate symbols of cultural materialism until she is ultimately overpowered and raped by the transcendental image of the Devil. The paintings that followed had no overt religious symbolism. The humanoids in the pictures had become phantoms and manikins. (/Alchemical Love/, 1985.) They were painted as empty shells caught in clich�d, mundane, staged environments. Finally, these environments became empty rooms within which inanimate objects carried only subliminal traces of their ghostly inhabitants. (/Red Interior/, 1985.) At this point the human narrative ended in my work.

In 1986 I turned to natural observation. The preceding work had reached some kind of conclusion. Making paintings from the direct observation of Nature was an honest and immediate way to rejuvenate myself and my work. The large oil paintings from 1987 to 1989 are composites of dozens of small studies painted on site. They are observations of the cycles of light and darkness, the movement of the wind and the elements over the sky, earth and water. Natural Phenomenon has taken the place of Human Narrative. The new work is more poetic and less literal. My hope is that the viewer will experience the emotional content of this work on a visceral level, like listening to music.

In the late seventies and early eighties, I was acutely aware of my precarious position: I was a young woman painting; working in a predominantly male art-form, trying to overturn my position as Object and reclaim the territory of female sexuality. While working in New York in 1979, I began investigating the most extreme form of feminine objectification, (ultimately human objectification), to be found in the mass media: pornography and prostitution. I had to abandon my brushes and put myself in front of the camera in a piece of what I, at the time, called "life art". I modeled for an ad for a brothel in /Screw/ magazine. I used a blowup of the ad in an installation piece in an exhibition titled /Destroy Those Pictures /at ChromaZone in 1981. My direct experience with pornography allowed me to become a "conscious" Object. This was necessary for me to feel justified in using pornographic imagery in my paintings; not as a voyeur but as a participant.

In 1980, the Feminine Principle, in the guise of the Virgin and the Mother-Goddess, surfaces in my paintings. I had been studying the writing of Carl Jung and Eric Neuman since 1976 and was aware of the recurring Archetypes in the historical religions of the world since the Paleolithic "Venuses". I exhibited a series of paintings depicting mainly the Christian Virgin in contemporary environments at Mercer Union titled /Madonna/ in 1981.

Renaissance angels entered the paintings in 1982. After returning from the exhibition, /O KromaZone/in West Berlin, I was hospitalized with arthritis. I was unable to walk or use my hands. While recovering in hospital, I made a series of works on paper that introduced the symbol of the spirit penetrating and informing matter, the Angel. These pieces were reproduced in the first issue of /C/ magazine. After my release from hospital I made a series of paintings of angels in bars and cafes of New York, Toronto and Berlin. These pieces were exhibited at the 49th Parallel and the Carmen Lamanna Gallery in 1983, and /Toronto Painting '84/ at the Art Gallery of Ontario.

The angel imagery was replaced by the demonic in the 1984 exhibition at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery. In this exhibition the paintings illustrate images from the unconscious. Dreams. Fantasies. Contemporary icons � guns, cars, TV personalities and "punks" live with the flow into primordial devils.

During the period from 1985 to1986, overt symbolism was gradually replaced by an interest in perceptual distortion. The images are made from observation and found media images. But these paintings are really about space. The extreme concavical distortion of empty rooms draws the viewer into the painting. The viewer becomes Subject. The viewer's perception of the invented spatial illusion is the content of the paintings.

By 1987, I had abandoned narrative representation to work from the observation of nature. Studies from site were developed in the studio into a monumental scale. The resolution of the work depended on the viewer being visually engulfed by the paintings; to be "inside" the invented space. They were exhibited in 1988 and 1989 at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery and numerous public galleries. An excerpt from the statement written for the exhibitions � "�like listening to music."

The Montreal Massacre in 1990 jarred my attention back to figurative art. The paintings refocused on human representation. /The Nature Paintings /and the interiors are ongoing.

The new paintings of 1989-1994 employ western symbols of the divine Child/Nature/Mysticism/Science, interested by current images from journalists, art, pornography and advertising. If these paintings "mean" anything it is in the way the pictures in them act on and resonate within the viewer.

Painting can safely be explained as pleasant design and perceptual system. But sometimes we glimpse proof of the frailty of our contemporary belief in an orderly rational universe. This is when a painting can strike fear and loathing in our civilized composure. Painting as threat.

Painting as a diagram of inner experience draws a precarious line between the /monde concrete /we bump into and the unknowable dimensions of thought: the dance of madness and reason. In this reflexive visual ritual we recognize our own inner perceptions as we recognize a stranger's interpretation of the objective world. We remember the precognitive visual language of our species as it is reflected back to us from painting: our animal-mystic dreams. Our self-knowledge is more than the splashing about of electro-chemical storms in our brains. Mystery betrays the known.

Painting is a perceptually abstract construction. Paintings are visible as translations of sensory memory within the biological structure of the brain. But they are viewed and reconstructed in the mind's eye. Painting's sensual quality of colour and tactility act as emotional transmitters, re-attaching our isolated psyches to the spiritual identity of our species.

Sometimes sublime reactions can be aroused in the viewer. Understanding what we perceive in a painting cannot be measured in space and time. The shifting representation of conventional truth resides on the surface of memory. The memory and history of perception is kept alive in the manual tracings of painting, recording the internal reality of our transient lives.

These paintings do not intend to lull the viewer with the security of images and text mediated through conventional photo-realism or French philosophy; rendering any content safely detached and academic. Nor is the viewer entertained with the wallpaper of abstract "compositions". These paintings are uneasy fragments existing between objective experience and subjective perception. The content of these paintings exists in the conceptual space between conventional representation and the boundaries of the invisible. March 21, 1995.

I began working from nature on site in 1987. The first exhibition if this work was in 1988 in a solo show at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery, Toronto. My most recent outdoor work was exhibited in October, 1995 at the Justina Barnicke Gallery, Hart House, University of Toronto.

Much of my work has been and continues to be devoted to social commentary. In 1983 I exhibited a series of paintings of angels in downtown Toronto and West Berlin clubs, at the 49th Parallel, New York, curated by the late Carmen Lamanna. It was titled /Commentary '92-'93/, and included Joanne Tod, John Brown and Marc Deguerre. I continued this work seen at the /Toronto Painting '84/ exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario. The most recent exhibition in this vein was titled /Bambino Miracolo /in collaboration with Paul Petro Comtemporary Art, Toronto, May '95.

/The Nature Paintings /began in 1987 after moving to Flesherton, a village 30 minutes south of Owen Sound. I have been painting my pond in Flesherton from basically the same vantage point for nearly ten years now. The image of the pond, sky and trees is a constant in the environment, but the elements: the wind and weather, the passage of night to day and the seasons [are ever changing].

When I first began painting nature I was uneasy because I felt that relevant contemporary painting could not include pictures of trees. It definitely could not include imagery that could be associated with the Group of Seven. Many artists and academics alike considered their kind of painting a quaint nationalist movement of the 20s and 30s.

It has been difficult for me to reconcile my late 20th Century sensibilities with my obsession with chronicling the seasons passing over my pond in Flesherton. Lately, I have come to think that the need to paint my environment comes simply from existing as a northern person who is constantly engaged with surviving our extreme elements. The northern experience is tied to the sun's retreat into long cold nights and the fleeting endless days of summer. The forces of Nature are etched as deeply in our psyches now as when Tom Thompson, Emily Carr and the Group of Seven were making their paintings in the true north strong and free. Today, in 1996, I work in a spirit much like theirs. I continue to find a source of regenerating creative power for my work in the relentless force of nature.

Function Drawing is an organic scan of the underworld. Drawing is the first place amorphous inklings congeal into objective form. Drawing mediates between the invisible interior world and the mechanistic physical perception of itself. Between Knowing and Seeing.

Method I begin drawing. Black marks onto a white surface. Organic manual tracings from the void into the light. I observe the immediate environment: walls, baseboards, floors, television sets, trees, moon, water, rain. Images from favourite picture books. The memory of another place or a person or an object may penetrate the surface. An unsolicited image may reveal itself. The drawing is complete when the marks have defined each element in accord with its momentary resolution.

Object Black marks on a white surface. The marks have been isolated and meshed, ordered by human intelligence. The viewer reabsorbs the marks. An adjustment of focus is induced to accept the information. The object releases its amorphous tracings of the underworld into the eye of the viewer.

I create installations, sculptures and paintings reflecting on social issues and the human condition. Originally from South Africa, I became a Canadian citizen in 2011. In the 90's I created walk-in situational paintings, often with audio. 'The Death of Lucas' was inspired by a mob murder that took place in front of me. The story is on my website.

In 1992 I co-founded Dasart, an artist's collective dedicated to socialist installations. We suppressed individual identities, mounting several national and international traveling exhibitions. 'Dasart/Victoria' installation contrasted 19th Century optimism with the late 20th Century industrial age detritus. We used old colonial maps, coal, concrete, iron and rubber with motors, sound and electricity to create a frenetic environment, contrasted with serene Victorian paintings.

In 1999-2002 'Transmigrations', traveled to Los Angeles and Tijuana, afterwards it also traveled nationally. 'Transmigrations' represented a culturally diverse selection of South African artists whose work reflected a non-commercial approach. In a spirit of inclusivity we invited local artists of like-mind to exhibit with us. The exhibition was nominated for Tijuana's Cultura Premios award. One of my contributions was a kinetic piece called 'Bullet'. The viewer moves a lever to propel the 'bullet' into a 'torso' that opens on impact and falls forward. This symbolizes Western Civilization's impact on Africa.

My last African installation, 'Cannibal Communicator: The Congo Holocaust', was a motorized mouthpart sculpture with audio relating the history of the Congo from when HM Stanley explored the Congo River to the excesses of King Leopold who was extracting wild rubber as a tax. A cavernous ribcage supports light-boxes with images taken by the missionaries at the time of the atrocities committed by Leopold's Cannibal army. The soundtrack uses a confessional aesthetic.

In Toronto I have continued my narrative Primal series that address sexual, religious and cultural attitudes, transgressing to find the animal within. We anthropomorphize animals and are familiar with characters like 'Peter Rabbit'. These tragicomic paintings reverse this, questioning the nature of reality and individuality. 'Rue' is set in a parched land since the environment consumes us as we devour it. The inspiration was a book called Super Freakonomics that proposed substituting cows with kangaroos since they emit less methane. The snake-man's erection is symbolic of Capitalism's sexual and unreasoning will to power. 'Promiguous' muses on mastectomy and idealism. Australian scientists have been growing human breasts on pigs as replacements. I borrowed from Titian's "Danae", referring to the odalisque tradition as an ideal of Western womanhood.

The new Intuit Series paintings explore a hybrid figural abstraction. The titles are verbs implying action as a process of becoming. I have been influenced by David Bohm's concept of Implicate Order, where everything is interconnected and enfolded within, thus bypassing the particle/wave dilemma. 'Impregnate' is a poetic evocation of that process. 'Exfoliate' is a gut response to the brutal skinning alive of cats and dogs for their pelts. 'Cybernate' references the cybernetics of Gregory Bateson, which addresses the structural patterns in all living systems. 'Operate' is a 'portrait' of my friend, Diane Victor, a great South African artist, who has polycystic kidney disease and urgently requires a kidney transplant.

The Crimes Against Animality Series are monumental Social Conscience paintings that explore human and animal histories. Ambient soundtracks are created in Garageband using my voice and other sound effects. Ultrasound directional speakers transmit the sound in a narrow 1-foot beam. 'Xenotransplant', (2011) references failed experiments to farm interspecies organs. Genetically modified pig organs were grafted onto baboons, who host the organs until transplantation into humans. The soundtrack consists of interior body sounds overlaid with conversation about the experiment and baboons (Quicktime 49min available on my website using Safari). Additional subjects in this series include shark finning, fracking, Aversion Therapy, female genital mutilation, farm animal exploitation, genetically modified food, rhino horn trade and other topics of concern.

My modus operandi is to create a visual timeline telling a story, utilizing key moments, composed within an overall unity that combines realistic passages with abstraction. Caesuras of visual information are stacked using unusual perspectival viewpoints and rhythmic passages to guide the viewer's eye through the painting. Simultaneously time-based and aesthetically timeless, the paintings try to condense stories into a unitary experience, yet in a beautiful manner.

Social Conscience paintings strive to articulate a message about use/abuse of the environment, animals and humans. I believe that animals have sentience and that our environment exists by virtue of symbiotic relationships. I see these works as art engaging with important social issues of our time, outside the normal aesthetic discourse and perhaps having more in common with Social Practice maneuvers. My content has synchronicities with animal rights groups. I believe that allure is important in any effort to communicate or allow for comprehension of our effect on the environment due to ingrained habits like the use of oil, fur and general consumption.

/*Origins*/ I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1958 and lived through the Apartheid era. Because of this my art tends to be socialist. I relocated to Toronto, Canada in 2005.

*Primal Series Paintings* These are story paintings that address sexual taboos and uncomfortable subject matter. There are many precedents in other cultures where animals are combined with human forms. The Primal paintings also bring into consideration the nature of reality and individuality. Humans often anthropomorphize animals so we have creatures like 'Peter Rabbit'. My art goes in the opposite direction, looking for the animal in the human psyche. I am interested in how religion has influenced our culture and our ways of interacting with the environment. It causes a kind of blindness to reality.

/*Trance Dance*/ The San or Bushmen, have an interesting concept of the power possessed by animals. It is called n/um and is an energy that can be beneficial or destructive to humanity if not channeled. The San perform the Trance Dance, which is a healing ritual, around a fire at night. The women sit in a circle and clap the intricate rhythms of wordless songs that are named after "strong" things like Eland or Gemsbok antelopes. The men dance in a line within the circle and alternate the vortices by changing direction. Spirit animals are attracted to the dance site. The dancers describe a boiling in their stomachs and begin to see pathways of light that lead to the spirit world. At a point some go into a trance that enables them to blend with the spirit world and in certain cases become spirit animals. This allows them to transcend physical barriers and become shamans. These healers seek the "sickness" in the other individuals, drawing it out through sites like belly buttons. Finally, they collapse exhausted and are coaxed back to life by the others through song and stroking.

/*Newton versus Quantum Mechanics*/ Our common view of reality is as a space/object/time phenomenon. This Newtonian perception is directly challenged by Quantum Mechanics, a new physics where distinguishable objects in space become indistinguishable at a sub atomic level. The subjectivity of the observer also affects the outcome of whether a particle or a wave is perceived in experiments.

/*The Reality Dilemma*/ Western thought is transfixed by absolutes, so things are either true or false but never both simultaneously. The conceptual lexicon is uncomfortable with ambiguity or contradiction.

/*The Individual*/ It is the nature of perception that we project what we see rather than just receive information. We visualize and assign properties to objects and situations according to predetermined cultural decisions. For instance, we emphasize the individual in Western Culture, imagining a body separate from surroundings. Quantum Mechanics denies separation. San people experience the spirit world as a manifestation of their reality and do not emphasize individualism. To them the supernatural is real.

/*Reality is complex */ Cultures like the San Bushmen of the Kalahari or the Australian Aborigines have no problem reconciling alternative versions of reality. They see experiential reality as part of an overall Dreamtime or Spirit-world. One of the features of this way of thinking is to see the animals and environment as part of the self and vice versa.

/*A New Way of Seeing*/ The reason to develop a new way of seeing is to alter our effect on the environment. Instead of seeing a tree we need to see the larger organism. Boundaries must be relinquished so that environment merges with self. The San provide an example of a culture that achieves this. It seems to me that the Western notion of the individual is really just a paradigm and that creative endeavour could reinvent the persona and by extension, the society. If the 'environment' were contained within the idea of the 'self' perhaps we would pay more attention to it and devise better structures of governance.

/*Telling Stories*/ The Primal stories delve into the underbelly of society, exposing taboos and crossing boundaries. The point of bringing these hidden aspects into view is to re examine outmoded ways of thinking in an effort to permit new vision. It is a process of un-censoring.

My paintings begin from the black and white photographs I take of the sterile interiors of such seemingly public spaces as the lobbies' of multinational corporations or the underground passageways that control the flow of people. As a woman, my relation to public space has always been problematised by gender and power relations. The photographs I take in this performative aspect of my process are psychological impressions, located everywhere yet nowhere, rather than an attempt at literal documentation. Both the photographs and the paintings that evolve from them are visualizations of feminist geography.

One of my major concerns is with the hybrid space of our contemporary globalized environment. In these spaces, the real and the virtual mingle becoming immersive, destabilizing and ecstatic. In the spaces through which I travel, photographing becomes a transgressive act done with the knowledge that I am under electronic surveillance, surveying the surveyors. But, I am primarily watched not by the desiring 19th century man, the flâneur who, in part, once watched women on the streets of Paris but by the all seeing electronic eye. Panopticonic space has moved outside of Jeremy Bentham's prison censoring our actions even in our blind spots. Extending beyond the urban 'gaze' of the surveillance camera, now we can all be tracked and positioned even in the wilderness. Space has collapsed blending the near and the far, the real and the virtual, the urban and the rural. In my paintings I try to visualize this new globalized space that is layered and fluid. I merge impressions of my present urban environment with, for example, those seen on T.V. of a bomb exploding in a remote village, memories of living for four months in a tent on Meares Island, B.C., or looking out of a train window going across Siberia.

I see the surfaces of my paintings as hovering somewhere between skin and screen caressed by my touch but with no tracking of the hand/brush visible. The colour is purposely fake. Life has turned into 'still life' frozen on the screen, reflected in the glass, observed, recorded, transmitted, digitized. The elongated format of the paintings envelops our gaze and reflects back to the historic panoramic photos and paintings of natural wonders. Translucent shiny layers of colour act as both barriers and filters that position the viewers or spectators as the surveyors looking out from the gaps or 'windows' in the imagined viewing chambers.

The extreme contrasts of light and dark evoke the sublime, but not the sublime in nature seen in the work of the 19th century painters such as Friedrich and Turner. Now that nature has been observed, measured, subjected to experiments and tabulated as part of the Enlightenment Project, it may retain its beauty but in our arrogance we assume that it has lost much of its sense of terror intrinsic to the sublime. In out ability to evoke this emotion 'god' has been replaced by man. Within the contemporary world, man's technological achievements have become the new sublime, the techno-sublime. But in assuming this role of 'god' have we become Mary Shelley's Dr Frankenstein?

/Mythes ou realites/*

Mon travail artistique porte essentiellement sur les séries. Lors de stages au Banff Centre for the Arts à la fin des années 1980, j'ai découvert la 'Generation X' et ai poursuivi ce thème pendant d'une décennie. J'ai trouvé ces jeunes conscientisés et, comme moi, préoccupés par les problèmes écologiques et les choix politiques. Leur questionnement a vite rejoint mon intérêt social et m'a amenée à ma recherche actuelle sur écologie.

Selon les Nations-Unies, la dégradation de l'environnment menace de rendre stérile près du quart des continents. J'ai donc abordé ma plus récente série en ayant pour objectif de mettre en lumière la négligence, l'insouciance, le manque de clairvoyance de certains dirigeants, mais aussi les blessures causées par le déboisement abusif, la culture intensive, le surpâturage, voire l'extrême nécessité de populations pauvres, pour ne nommer que ces quelques abus sur la nature. La désertification étant tout la perte de terre arabe.

Elevée dans un endroit bucolique, je conserve de mon enfance des souvenirs d'une nature vierge et magnifique, qui me montrent par relation le bouleversement que le pseudo progrès a fait subir à la planète. Ces parcelles de mémoire m'incitent quelquefois à montrer deux versions d'un même paysage, l'une, celle de mes souvenirs, et l'autre, marquée par le temps, meurtrie parfois irrémédiablement. C'est le cas pour le tableau /Écologie/Désertification, séq. IV/, rappelant la dureté de la terre craquelée et, en opposition, /Écologie/Désertification, séq. V/, offrant la douceur et la poésie d'un champ de blé.

Les toiles de grand format deviennent des lieux de réflexion où le spectateur, ne se sentant pas menacé, est contraint de constater l'évolution de la nature. Fondamentalement, il m'importe que les supports et les techniques choisis favorisent la compréhension de mon travail, tant sur le plan formel que sur celui du contenu. À cela s'ajoute un intérêt pour le texte comme ponctuation ou ajout à mon écriture visuelle.

Techniquement et d'office, je privilégie le grand format, l'acrylique pour sa maniabilité et la figuration pour son aptitude à favoriser la compréhension de mon propos. Toutefois, la lumière demeure indéniablement l'axe principal de ma recherche.

/*THE CIRCLE OF HISTORY*/ Paintings by Gyula Kalko   	/Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity./                 W.B. Yeats, 1939.

Sir Kenneth Clark concluded his popular /Civilization/ TV series in 1969 with this famous, darkly prophetic poem. Yet, these same ominous words could be evoked to describe the sense of chaos we experience today. At the dawn of the 21th century our world is increasingly permeated by a profound sense of intellectual and spiritual anxiety in the face of exploding technologies and constant social, political, and economic change. Tribalism, AIDS, famine, surging nationalism, ethnic cleansing, religious fanaticism and war as television entertainment have replaced the promised 'peace dividend' in the wake of communist collapse. The New World Order has not emerged. The centre lacks cohesive focus.

Mankind appears to be no more in control of its destiny today, than at any other time in the history of civilization. There is an element of the 'shock of recognition' in the contemporary relevance found in images throughout the history of art, which offers a vast array of evidence that human nature has not changed at all. Hunger for dominance and power, insatiable greed, violence and exploitation, were all subjects that the Old Masters dealt with over and over again. This familiarity is part of the underlying power through which their images continue to speak to us on a universal level.

In this series of paintings by Toronto artist, Gyula Kalko, the appropriated details of familiar works from the history of Western art illustrate deeply rooted parallels and connections of the human condition between past and present societies. The simulated x-ray panels (a byproduct of scientific scrutiny used in art conservation) work as a formal device through which historical distance, and a sense of detachment from the past, is established and the ambiguity of the connection with the present is communicated. The sections painted realistically and in full colour represent contemporary society and deal with subject matter that effects all of us.

In biblical times it was greed and megalomania that caused the Tower of Babel to crumble, just as surely as they make fortunes rise and fall today. The fatigue and resignation of the guardsman, captured in a painting by Carel Fabritius, is the same as that of an exhausted and frustrated UN peacekeeper. As the exuberant and provocative parades on Gay Pride Day in cities across North America speak of prevalent social pressures, so the hedonistic bacchanalia processions depicted by Annibale Carracci on the ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese point to the battle of ideologies in 17th century Rome. Whether cloaked in antiquity by Poussin or captured by TV cameras on the streets of Sarajevo, the atrocities and horrors of war outrage us all the same. The possibilities of poignant associations are many.

The essence of being is in the act of having compassionate understanding; a simple notion that encompasses all that is social and political within the sphere and limits of one's own environment and personal experiences.

My work is an act of being in the world; a celebration of all and nothing.

During the last 20 years my work has been a personal journey exploring my strong and passionate affinity for the still life. For me, nature embodies both a spiritual and physical expression of the extraordinary and commonplace.

I paint nature, not as an exact imitation of its external appearances, but through it's inherent somber and tranquil qualities. I use these attributes of nature to create a contemplative mood that invites thought and reflection.

I identify closely with the materials I use and the compositional devices I employ; structural fragmentation, glazes, three-dimensional and two-dimensional space, and colour. I use these materials and devices for their inherent natural and abstract characteristics, sensual and textural aspects, and for their symbolic qualities.

In essence my goal is to make works that simply dissolve the line between emotion and intellection, between art and nature, and transcend to a state of being, of pure existence for its own sake; for its own beauty and pain; for its own vulnerability and timeless qualities. My aim, my desire, is to create paintings that reflect both on history and on the immediacy of today through subtle and abrupt changes that reveal the dichotomy of what is presented and what is understood.

Over the past few years I have turned to the works of artists such as Chardin, Morandi, de Chirico, Magritte, Anselm Keifer, Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse. It is the mood, emotion and intellect of their works that I respond to. Keeping within the spirit of the above-mentioned artists I create works that are evocative and non-moralizing.

My recent work is minimal in nature and structure. The simplified perspective of the canvas setting enables me to delve deeper into the fragile drama of both drawing and painting. I refer to these new works as "my poetic-philosophical excursion into the realm of lust and austerity; the naked presence of Life amongst the Broken Rhythm and Voids of Architectural Grandeur... Beautiful Anxiety".

This work is the most recent in a series of installations and sculpture and, like previous work is motivated by an interest in the relationship of human beings to nature and material culture. The source for the work is biotechnology and genetic manipulation of nature, which is reshaping our relationship to the natural world in dramatic ways. Increasingly, humans shape nature itself-with the potential for big impacts on our lives and all aspects of daily living.

Thinking about the ways in which humans intervene in nature leads to a lot of, "What if?" questions. For example, let's look at what 's happened to a variety of fruits, vegetables, chickens and other foods as a result of human intervention. It seems that much of the flavour has been leached out of many foods. Certainly, we can be sure that tastelessness isn't a quality that anyone wanted but it looks like that's what has occurred. It is an unintended byproduct of intervention in the natural world. *So what if, as a result of the stepped up pace of genetic meddling in the natural wold, all the leaked out of nature?* – adding a new dimension to dystopian scenarios envisioned by artists and others.

In summary, research into biotechnology and the use of compute applications led to a dystopian scenario rather than an utopian vision-a body of work centered on the question of, "What if all the color leaked out of nature?", leaving it colorless and black. Could this really happen? Probably not, but the work is intended to call attention to the experience of a natural world that is being indelibly altered by many different kinds of human intervention, especially the genetic modification of plants and animals. The boundaries between nature and culture become blurred as we remake nature from the inside out and the tempo of intervention accelerates.

These pieces have been developed using computer programs, which enable the artist to manipulate and re-contextualize images from nature. The original images of seedpods, fungus, flowerheads, were transformed and then made in black and colorless materials such as casting resin, vinyl, and fiberglass. Although the works begin with forms from nature, because of computer manipulation of the original images and the use of highly processed materials, these become strange hybrids, artificial forms which retain vestiges of their origin in nature.

L’espace est grand, rectangulaire et parallèle à la rue Ste-Catherine: il serait donc orienté selon un axe est-ouest. En y pénétrant, on en a une vue fragmentaire et l’on doit s’avancer pour découvrir graduellement, à sa droite, le reste de la galerie et ce qui s’y trouve installé. La vue d’ensemble se reconstruit mentalement au fur et à mesure du parcours.

Le mur est de la galerie reçoit en après-midi une tache de soleil qui le balaie d’un bout à l’autre; le soleil entre par les fenêtres du mur nord. C’est que l’est et l’ouest qui servent de repères dans cette ville sont décalés par rapport aux points cardinaux. La géographie urbaine ne coïncide pas avec la réalité géographique, ce qui nous permet d’avoir du soleil nord nord-ouest. Ce ne sont peut-être que deux systèmes de conventions qui se heurtent; et puis les choses sont souvent autres que ce qu’elles semblent être. Ce type d’idée reçue conditionne cependant la perception et le rapport à ce qui nous entoure, insidieusement.

*Trois sculptures*

La première occupe un espace carré au sol et est composée de neuf blocs placés à quelques centimètres les uns des autres, suivant un quadrillage régulier. Leurs faces externes sont blanchies, de façon inégale; les faces internes, brutes, laissent évident leur mode de construction. Ensemble, ils ne forment qu’un seul volume, fragmenté. Leurs dimensions sont à peu près semblables, leurs hauteurs varient un peu. Les dessus des blocs sont grossièrement hachurés, grugés, sillons ou vagues qui creusent dans la surface une dépression.

La deuxième occupe un espace carré au sol et est composée de trois volumes rectangulaires, alignés régulièrement à quelques centimètres les uns des autres. Ensemble, ils ne forment aussi qu’un seul volume, fragmenté. Leurs dimensions sont à peu près semblables, leurs hauteurs varient au centre, mais très peu. Les faces externes, en périphérie du volume, sont noircies et l’encadrent; les faces internes sont laissées brutes, comme les dessus, formés par stratification; un léger relief dessine, sur la surface vibrante et inégale, un frisson.

La troisième occupe un espace irrégulier et vague au sol, et est composée de cinq éléments plutôt courbes, bombés, qui semblent s’être en partie affaissés les uns sur les autres. Ils pourraient être issus d’un seul volume, éclaté. Les faces externes sont texturées, rugueuses et sombres, les faces internes lisses et pâles; les tranches sont brutes et laissent évident leur mode de construction. Les cinq sont de dimensions à peu près semblables, mais leurs orientations varient. Près de la première et de la deuxième sculpture, la troisième semble un peu délinquante, une inversion.

*Mur*

Au mur, des panneaux, dont le statut reste incertain; des lignes, des taches, des masses, un minimum d’interventions faites sur des contreplaqués accrochés d’une façon régulière. Ni vraiment surfaces brutes, ni vraiment dessins, ni vraiment peintures, ils forment une collection d’images indéfinies et floues dont le rapport de l’une à l’autre tient plus à une juxtaposition quasi aléatoire d’écarts et d’oppositions qu’à une continuité ou à une logique évidente. Ils participent d’une certaine forme d’indétermination.

*Enumérations:*

Ces pièces sont autonomes, pourtant, d’une certaine façon, elles reforment un tout, fait d’îlots. Elles sont ordonnées d’une manière rigoureuse et précise, et malgré tout semblent relever d’un certain chaos. Elles paraissent sobres et connues, mais paradoxalement elles ne se laissent pas classifier aisément et renvoient à des images autres que celle de leur réalité première. Au lieu d’un travail de sculpture et de peinture, ce serait peut-être un travail de collage, où peinture et sculpture retournent à une réalité générique et deviennent un matériau de base.

A la source du travail présenté ici, il y avait des mots, épars, qui ont servi à le structurer, mots qui ont une correspondance parallèle au travail, et qui renvoient à des images, à des concepts, en vrac; pris isolément, ou agglutinés, on peut y voir des clés, des indices, des amorces, ou rien du tout. Mots et collages comme: écart, éloignement, limite, fissure, anomalie, amas, stratification, incertitude, opposition... opposition des termes, écarts et correspondances, imbrication des systèmes, précision du flou, stratification de sens... Mots qui suggèrent que les pièces sont à la limite (de la sculpture, de la peinture, de l’installation), et seraient plutôt le reflet de formes connotées, entretenant un doute sur la pertinence des catégories habituelles issues de nos acquis culturels; que les pièces, à la fois précises et floues, jouent sur une frontière plus ou moins déterminée où l’opposition des termes se fond, où les systèmes s’imbriquent et où les contraires sont interdépendants, évoquant une forme de complexité diffuse. Ouverts et peu directifs, ces collages contiennent potentiellement une somme d’information, sorte de synthèse latente et non dogmatique qui laisse la pensée voguer d’une idée à l’autre sans se replier sur la précision. Par analogie, c’est peut-être ce qui évoque le mieux, d’une façon simple, la pensée visuelle, pensée globale, fonctionnant par images, qui saisit rapidement et entièrement les concepts, les rapports, les situations et les choses. Si la pensée verbale est la pensée de la précision et de l’analyse, puisqu’elle dissèque et interprète, la pensée visuelle serait celle d’une synthèse immédiate et englobante, non linéaire.

Peu importe ce que l’on investit dans un travail, il n’y a aucune certitude que ce qu’on y voit, que ce qu’on y met, soit effectivement perçu. Ce qui est retenu ne se limite souvent qu’à un sujet, à une dimension anecdotique, narrative. Le regard critique est un regard extérieur; la distance critique que l’on peut prendre face à son propre travail reste toujours teintée, biaisée; le seuil d’appréhension est déjà franchi et la disponibilité n’a pas à être sollicitée. J’ai donc essayé de faire ce texte autour de mon travail, sans trop chercher à analyser, à rationaliser ni à justifier mes choix; en tentant simplement de transposer en mots la structure de pensée qui le génère, en la suggérant, en l’effleurant au lieu de l’affirmer, et en essayant de rendre une des particularités des arts visuels: une oeuvre peut être structurée par stratification, par blocs de sens qui coexistent simultanément, qui sont présents en superposition, mais sans qu’il n’y ait de hiérarchie obligée. Mais tout travail d’écriture partant d’un travail visuel demeure tentative de traduction, opérant le passage d’un mode de pensée à un autre, et un travail de traduction reste une interprétation, une approximation...

Following art school, I struggled to find a process of art making that could distinguish me. I wanted to make art that reflected my interests and personality. Intrigued by a painting by Philip Taaffe that consists of a simple 1:1 ratio of two contrasting colours, the contrast of colour acting to elevate the surface wave pattern from the background colour, inspired me to experiment with this concept, utilizing cardboard templates of various shapes. At the same time, my interest in fibre arts led to employment as a hand weaver for a coat manufacturer, allowing the loopy line motif in my paintings to be solidly referenced by my employment. Using yarn from the shelves at work as a guide from which to mix colour, further refined the connection between daily life and making art. As I continue to reconfigure shape, pattern and colour placement, this palette of 32 colours has come to characterize the Abstract Repeat series of paintings, the result being the completion of over100 works.

After graduating from Ontario College of Art in 1989 I was fortunate to participate in artistic endeavours presented by the artist collective Painting Disorders. My work has been included in many group and solo exhibitions, from artist run initiatives to public and private galleries including Art Gallery of Ontario, Power Plant (Toronto), Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver), Edmonton Art Gallery and Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo). My work is represented by Wynick/Tuck Gallery in Toronto.

I often spit out my dirty secrets on to beds. The loaded references of this site beg for the whispering of my secrets, spoken through scared sheets, feather breasts and fluffy pink wool nests. They invite me to stitch, stuff, spit and smear imaginary shapes that are expressions of my inner worlds made outer. The sculptural pieces become the amalgamation and display of my repetitive gestures, a trace of their history.

The videos and performances render my loaded gestures the primary focus. They depict me testing the limits of my subjectivity by pushing gum in and out of my mouth, or digging in to my belly button as a futile quest for my essence. This work employs my bodily curves, orifices and excretions to investigate and represent my subjectivity in relation to sexuality, love, comfort and abuse. The theatre of confessions at the centre of my work constructs an illusion of intimacy with myself and invites you to examine my vulnerabilities and obsessions.

My taboo-ridden pieces are often like a putrid smell everyone tries to ignore. It's like licking make-up off someone's face and revealing their imperfections. I try to lick the audience's face with my gooey tongue in an effort to shake their framework of what constitutes the speakable. Just to see if I can. Just to see if you will listen.

When ideas thumble from our mouth, the better explained, the easier to understand.

This seems proof that ideas taking objective form fall under the realm of aesthetics.

Such is the information contained in a bee’s dance; which include the sun-oriented, hourly-changing direction from the hive to a field of flowers.

A bee's dance leads to far reaching speculations on content in the artwork of the naked ape.

Evan Levy's cold rolled steel sculptures appeal to our tactile as well as poetic sensibilities. His work is strong, tense and assertive while at the same time, lyrical and sublime. Levy's eye gripping sculptures confront the viewer with their strength, but leave us feeling ambiguous in that they appear to be on the verge of springing apart under the stress employed by the artist. These are precarious works which leave the viewer to doubt their weightiness. They appear to have a life all of their own. Levy's ability to achieve this dichotomy with his material is astounding.

Evan Levy's poetry is an amalgamation of the influences processed and transformed by the artist. First of all, Levy is a nationalist and not an-insincere one at that. Apart from his affirmed beliefs about his country and its people's abilities, Levy draws a great deal of inspiration from the northern landscape. He states that, "As a nationalist, Canadian content isn't a choice, it is inevitable that 'Canadian' images are the most powerful for me...Canada is a country of wind and water - these are images of the north" For a city-weaned fellow, Levy captures these images extremely well, albeit with romantic apperception.

A reaction to the many associations made by those representing the 'art-world'. Levy attempts to render his work distinctive or devoid of art-historical reference-points. A purist in his approach to art-making, he reduces his sculpture to an elemental form; a derivation from a complex image to a near-skeletal remnant. Linda Genereux commented on Levy's ability to remove himself from art-historical associations while upholding the ability to provoke a variety of appropriations and interpretations by stating that, "Evan walks on both sides of the fence, disenfranchising the power of formalist abstraction while embracing the ability to proliferate a multiplicity of suggestions rather than one specific meaning." While Levy draws influence from externals, he states that his work is also prompted by strong internal forces: "images come in flashes, but capturing them requires effort and pondering - a subconscious process."

Levy's work has also been interpreted as the "symbolic representation of an ideal condition, perhaps even of perfection. In response to this reference made by Toronto Star art critic, Christopher Hume, Levy suggests that, "since the original image, or the inspiration of some natural form was in a sense perfect, the actual sculpture can only be a symbol of this original form."

Levy uses both organic and inorganic subject-matter in his sculptural work. He captures physical space. The artist masterfully winds up manipulating the physical forces of nature, in a seeming effort to try and define these forces. While this results in a fundamental transgression of original form to manmade form, it becomes evident that Levy admires the perfection in nature and attempts to recapture it.

Above it all, Levy remains fully aware of the power of his own objects. His criticism of the art-world lies in their tendency to get lost in art-historical references and comparisons rather than celebrating the pure creation and endurance of the solid objects.

I make work about how messages are communicated and received. These are times of information overload, and being able to respond to what is important becomes increasingly difficult.

I am looking for ways to speak and to listen. My projects are varied in their material composition (photo installations, multi-media performances), and a recurring theme is the representation of my struggle to speak and to hear the expressions of others. A good exchange can be a transformative experience. It is a simple idea, but not easy to achieve. We put many barriers in front of this simple act, and I like to look at those barriers.

Exploring this theme of communications, I produced the installation /Hesitation/, which was exhibited on "The Main" or boulevard St. Laurent, which is the east-west dividing street of Montreal. It was a series of photographic signs, in the format of the traffic sign, attached to the lamp posts along each side of the street. In this show, there were approximately 20 works, extending for 4 kilometers on this main street in the city. The photographs depicted people, one of which being the artist, engaged in some form of awkward relationship. A patient expecting pain and a doctor who is preoccupied with the task; a white man and a black woman showing interest in each other, but feeling awkward at addressing their feelings; a group of young men threatening another man on the street. All of the characters are depicted having some kind of difficulty in terms of speaking their fear. They are afraid of looking stupid, or of being hurt, and they are not free.

Another, more recent work I produced, is the performance /Babble/, a work about how the mechanical aspects of contemporary communication transform our messages, and sometimes overwhelm the messages that are being sent. In this work, drum kits are hooked up to computers that are programmed to interpret the signals of the drums and generate texts with them. In one of the sections, the drummers play the drums in ASCII code (the code used by computers to interpret the keyboards that are attached to them) and the corresponding text is projected on to screens accompanying the performers. I write a simple text about making a machine to speak for me. It works in more or less the same way as computers do when we are typing messages, only much slower, and unlike a word processing program, if I make a mistake, I have to live with it. It is a speaking machine that so complicates the act of speaking that the message it delivers is rendered incomprehensible.

In conjunction with a theme of awkward or difficult communication is an attention to conditions of vulnerability. Making myself vulnerable, physically or socially, has been a essential part of my art practice from the beginning. There is a part of me that likes being scared. When you are scared, you are paying close attention to the things around you. The world is big and moves in slow motion. It’s very different from panicking, when you can’t pay attention to anything around you. Finding ways to go through fear without panicking is a game of self control that I enjoy on an almost daily basis.

Identity isn't given once and for all: it is built up and changes throughout a person's lifetime. Amin Maalouf, /In the Name of Identity/

For us humans, ever since we started living in time, there is no such thing as real-reality; always and only fictional-reality. Nancy Huston, /The Tale-Tellers/

Janet Logan's work is based on making research into identity and memory. To do this, she must look back over her life, but this also means she has to shape, interpret and invent her past. The titles of some of her individual exhibitions are revealing of her concerns, such as /M�moires et r�ves, Sucrerie et conte de f�es, Mythes, m�moires et r�alit�s /, as well as the title of one work /Elle a �t� �lev�e dans du coton (She was given a sheltered life) /. Who is Janet Logan? A woman, a feminist, a designer of costumes for the theatre, a painter, a visual artist creating installations, a translator, an Anglophone who moves in a Francophone milieu not to mention her particular character traits, which are not the subject of our reflection but which are an integral part of her identity.

Since 1992, her research on identity has been carried out through the creation of installations where she uses material that has a link to her past and interests her today: fabric, women's clothing, wire netting and mesh, sponge, string, buttons, orange peel, etc., everyday objects that she finds among other places at Salvation Army thrift shops. Using this as her raw material, she transforms it, being inspired by the characteristic features of these materials such as their softness, weightiness, smoothness, or at times their hardness and denseness, always creating abstract objects. Her approach has similarities to that of Louise Bourgeois and Annette Messager, although both these artists work in a more narrative vein.

/Paysage, etc./ occupies two very precise spaces, the ground and the air, forming a homogeneous whole. Working with second-hand women's clothing in various shades of white that she takes apart and pieces together, Janet Logan suggests fragments of human bodies as she piles them up on the floor, on wooden crates and on an easel like dolls, stuffed animals or cushions. Abstract objects are suspended from the ceiling, juxtaposed next to each other, forming a whole that at first glance gives the impression of lightness and delicacy although some of the more prickly textures, certainly the metal, oppose that which is soft and comforting. A is tension created that, rather that being very menacing, seems to be the result of a certain anxiety. Moreover, this process of exhibition by suspension, amply used in the 20th century, was already highly valued in the 16th century -- for example, in the curio cabinets where one hung the most astonishing objects from the ceiling.

Since her 2005 installation titled /Elle a �t� �lev�e dans du coton/, the use of white in her work refers to the death of someone close and to an Asian symbolism where white is associated with death and mourning. In Asia, death is seen as the inevitable passage to a new world, a rebirth, evoking purity.

The process of creating itself is a key element in Janet Logan's work and it makes up an integral part of her research into identity. From the choice of material to the exploration and creating of forms in the studio until the installation of the work in the exhibition space, the whole creative process is imbued with a ludic quality that is a continuation of childhood play. The abstract forms thus created and collected together are the result of a merging of fiction and reality. They stimulate the viewer's imagination and give rise to various emotions, feelings, thoughts and most certainly reminiscences associated with childhood.

L'identité n'est pas donnée une fois pour toute, elle se construit et se transforme tout au long de l'existence. Amin Maalouf, /Les identités meurtrières/

Réel-réel : cela n'existe pas, pour les humains. Réel-fiction seulement, partout, toujours, dès lors que nous vivons dans le temps Nancy Huston, /L'espèce fabulatrice/

La démarche de Janet Logan repose sur la prémisse suivante : la recherche identitaire et la mémoire. Pour y parvenir, il lui faut retourner dans le passé, mais cela signifie nécessairement façonner, interpréter et inventer son passé. Les titres de quelques-unes de ses expositions solo sont d'ailleurs révélateurs de ses préoccupations, /Mémoires et rêves, Sucrerie et conte de fées, Mythes, mémoires et réalités/, ainsi que le titre de certaines de ses œuvres, tel /Elle a été élevée dans du coton/. Qui est donc Janet Logan? Une femme, féiniste, dessinatrice de costume pour le théâtre, peintre, artiste en art visuel (installations), traductrice, une anglophone qui évolue dans un milieu francophone, sans parler de ses traits de caract�re propres qui ne sont pas l'objet de notre réflexion, mais qui sont partie intégrante de son identité.

Depuis 1992, sa recherche identitaire se poursuit par la création d'installations où elle utilise des matériaux qui sont en lien avec son passé et habitent son présent : tissu, vêtement, filet, grillage, éponge, cordelette, bouton, pelure d'orange, etc., objets qu'elle trouvent entre autres à l'Armée du Salut. Le travail de la matière, qu'elle transforme au fil de son inspiration et les caractéristiques sensibles de ces matériaux - mollesse, pesanteur, douceur, parfois dureté et densité - s'effectue toujours dans l'abstraction. Son approche offre des similitudes avec celle de Louise Bourgeois et Annette Messager, quoique ces deux artistes travaillent essentiellement dans le registre de la narrativité.

/Paysage, etc. / occupe deux espaces bien précis (sol et air) pour former un tout homogène. Janet Logan empile au sol sur des coffres ou des chevalets telles des poupées, des peluches ou des coussins, des parties du corps humain qu'elle a réalisées à partir de vêtements, en camaïeu de blanc, qu'elle a défaits et recousus. Elle a crée des objets indéterminés, suspendus au plafond et qui, juxtaposés les uns près des autres forment un tout qui de prime à bord semble empreint de douceur et de légèreté, mais certaines des textures plus hérissés, entre autres le métal, s'opposent à ce qui est moelleux et réconfortant. Cette tension ainsi créé n'est aucunement menaçante, mais semble être le résultat d'une certaine anxiété. D'autre part, ce procédé d'exposition par suspension, amplement utilisé au XXe siècle, était déjà fort prisé au XVIe siècle - par exemple, dans les cabinets de curiosité on suspendait du plafond les objets les plus étonnants.

Depuis son installation de 2005 intitulée /Elle a été élevée dans du coton/, l'utilisation dans son œvre de tissu blanc renvoie au décès d'un proche et à toute une symbolique asiatique où le blanc est associé à la mort et au deuil. En Asie, la mort est vue comme un passage obligé vers un monde nouveau, c'est-à-dire une renaissance, et il évoque la pureté.

Le processus même de création demeure un élément clé dans le travail de Janet Logan et il constitue une partie intégrante de sa recherche identitaire. Du choix des matériaux au travail d'exploration et de réalisation des formes en atelier, jusqu'à l'installation dans la salle d'exposition, tout ce processus de création est investi d'une part ludique en continuité avec les jeux de son enfance. Les formes abstraites ainsi créées et rassemblées sont le résultat de la fusion du réel et de la fiction. Elles stimulent l'imagination, suscitent chez le spectateur diverses èmotions, des sensations, des réflexions et très certainement des réminiscences associées à l'enfance.

The primary theme of this work is lesbian public sex – as metaphor and practice. The work contests assumptions around the use of public space and lesbian sexual practice. In this series of photographs I claim dark corners of the city, and populate them with a lesbian (sexual) presence. A lesbian ‘flaneur’ couple wanders the sensual Montreal night.

In earlier work I examined and produced more literal images of lesbian sex (/Sapphic Scenes/ and the /Bed of Roses/ projects). For this series I looked for sites to insert shadowy figures that, once discovered, shift the meaning of the images. The figures operate as fleeting apparitions of lesbians and lesbian sex populating the city. The characters are more or less gender identifiable. The photos present four viewpoints: that of the voyeur/passerby observing the women in various locations in the city; urban nightscapes that the lovers see in their walk through the city; and from each of the lovers’ positions.

This is not anonymous sex. However, the photographs allow the viewer to enter the image and insert their own fantasy. I have deliberately established a female presence but kept the work open to multi-desiring viewers.

I am aware of the ‘Women of the Shadows’ metaphor threading through lesbian pulp novels to contemporary analysis of lesbian literature, for example, Terry Castle’s /The Apparitional Lesbian/. The photographs play on this metaphor along with the history of criminal and sexual danger sited in urban alleyways, i.e., Thomas Annan’s photographs of Glasgow alleys, Jacob Rii’s photos of criminal gangs in NYC, Brassai’s /‘The Secret Paris of the 30’s/, etc.

I titled the work –*Penetrating the Cit*y – in part, in response to the myth that lesbian sex is primarily, if not exclusively, oral sex. Lesbians are the only population for whom AIDS education safe sex has concentrated on the use of dental dams. Additionally, the work is a homage to Montreal the city and to Montreal photography. I pay tribute to the Montreal (neo Pictorialist) photo aesthetic while also slyly inserting lesbian sex into these romantic cityscapes.

My recent work employs different photographic forms (from the vernacular to high art) and borrows these forms to serve (unexpected) lesbian content. Using familiar forms I disrupt the comforting beauty of the surface to speak of issues that expand and contradict expectations.

This push pull of beauty, cliché, comfort and contradiction is active in much of my recent work. The previous exhibition /Road trip Diary/Journal de route/ played with the familiar aesthetic of postcards and family photographs and the experience of tourism and family holidays.

I have always been fascinated by the concept of time. What it might be, how it is perceived, how it is represented and what it symbolizes.

We live in a society that is structured and regulated by a ësymbolí of time. We have come to accept this symbol as a valid and real expression of what time is. However, this acceptance has been at the expense of our intuitive and subjective feelings about time.

Clocks have forced us to view time as detached, regimented and a structured entity that has a reality separate from ourselves. The equal intervals and numbers on the face of the clock further this perception.

While the 13th century development of this notion of time, ëmetric timeí, has also become one of the cornerstones of Western civilization. It has also been instrumental in alienating humans from themselves and each other. Without the metric time concept, science, industry and technology could not have developed. However, our sense of time as it relates to the environment and our biology has been suppressed in the process. I believe it has resulted in a human experience that is often skewed away from the essences of being human.

My clocks have been in the making for more then 30 years. They are an expression of my dissatisfaction with the traditional clock face as well as all of the notions behind that face.

Time cannot be constrained by merely mechanical devices. While it represents one way of looking at the world, I hope my clocks allow another.

Mes objets de création peuvent être considérés comme fossiles. C'est en peignant que le processus-même de création devient mon passage vers mes souvenances les plus profondes. Recouvrir la surface lisse d'une toile de confettis peints me semble tout à fait logique pour le genre de témoignage que je fais. Chaque tache de peinture confirme ma présence dans le temps. J'estime que la couleur est subjective et qu'elle peut être appliquée au hasard. J'enterre mes images des couches de peinture. Mes tableaux référent à la qualité granuleuse d'images médiatisées. L'interface numérique et le réseau ont influencé ma perception. Je considère mes images sans limites, ni bords, ni pourtour.

Lorsque je peins, je perçois de tous mes sens mon être dans le présent. Je peux dessiner n'importe quoi et le processus décompose les détails de la réalité en points discrets de couleur. Le résultat me fait réfléchir sur les limites concrètes du destin et de la désintégration corporelle.

Any object that I create could be considered a fossil. While making these works, the process of painting itself became a passageway to thought. Rendering a seamless surface from a flurry of confetti seemed to be appropriate for what I was doing. Each stroke of paint corresponded to my presence. I always felt that colour is subjective and can be applied almost randomly. Burying my renderings with layers of paint, I allude to the granular quality of the electronic media that I work with. The interface with the processor and network also made me realise that images need not be limited by edges.

As I work, I contemplate my sense of being. I can render anything and the process will break down details of a representation into discrete points of colour that evoke thoughts within me of the concrete limits of fate and the disintegration of physicality.

My painting can be seen as two streams of inquiry which ultimately seek to discover the same thing. The landscape paintings, which I have been making since the mid-1970s, seek to reveal my emerging understanding of the non-duality of nature. These works have gone through a range of artistic treatments, with the 1990s seeing a focus on space, light, atmosphere and distance.

I am intrigued with the sensation of being personally diminished when experiencing great spaces. Deserts, mountains, and vast open plains make me feel that some fundamental truth is revealed by this sense of dissolution into these spaces. My landscape paintings are made from memory, not from on-site drawings or photographs. I use memory as a filtering agent to remove nonessential visual elements. When a work is successful, it has a poetry that presents some aspect of my understanding of who I am.

The second stream of my work began in the early 1990s as a result of my Brucebo award (a Swedish Award). This opportunity to spend a summer in Gotland living and working at the William Blair Bruce estate helped me to formulate a second approach to painting.

First worked out as a series of small oil studies, I found that fields of pixelated colour dabs could combine into a colour field that did some of the things that I was also trying to coax out of my landscape paintings. The last nine years have seen me continuing to experiment with this idea. Some of these paintings have combined multiple images and colour fields. The images are carefully rendered from observation. The colour fields support the objects. Some of the most recent of these paintings have not included rendered images. These canvases are completely non-objective but are accompanied by small paintings of landscapes that are hung in relation to the colour field.

Jennifer Marman and Daniel Borins work collaboratively in the field of large format sculpture, mixed media, installation and electronic art.

Marman and Borins are known for their ability to creatively produce refined multimedia installations that are well-crafted, intricate and large scale. They have a diverse vocabulary that employs industrial and non-traditional materials and they are known and respected for their innovative approaches to sculpture.

The physicality of Marman and Borins’ work is central to their artistic practice. The resulting effect is sculpture that appears to be commercially produced, blurring the distinction between the mass-produced and the unique art object and thereby addressing the tensions between popular culture and the museum. This strong formal approach is contrasted by elements within their work that can be audacious, humorous and symbolically charged, with content often including mass media references. The result is work that echoes with art historical, popular culture, and structural significance. Philosophically they are interested in issues of subjectivity, mass visual language and the beholding of the work of art.

Engagement with the viewer is a primary focus for Marman and Borins and is initiated through the strong physical presence of their work. In many of their projects, electronic, kinetic and / or multimedia components serve to enhance the viewer’s reception of their art. Additionally, the beholder’s involvement is often intensified through the artist’s inclusion of interactive elements, inviting the viewer to become a participant in the work and creating two levels of reception: the participant and the observer.

Marman and Borins have also diversified their practice by experimenting with multi-formatted exhibitions of their work. Through the implementation and co-presentation of several artworks simultaneously, they display a form of installation art that echoes the tropes of the curated exhibition. The result of this work has been the production of large sculptures that carry clusters of smaller works formally and thematically linked within a compendium. The outcome of this approach to sculpture is to challenge the uniformity of serial art making.

Marman and Borins have shown work both in Canada and internationally, including exhibitions at Art Santa Fe, the University of Toronto, the Toronto International Art Fair, and the Scope Art Fair in Miami. Most recently they have been awarded a commission for the Toronto Sculpture Garden to debut in 2006. Marman and Borins have shown video works widely on an international level.

Marman and Borins have been invited to speak at a number of galleries and institutions, including: the National Gallery of Canada, The Power Plant’s Hub-Bub series, the Art Gallery of Ontario, University of Toronto, the Ontario College of Art and Design and Syracuse University.

Marman and Borins graduated from the Ontario College of Art and Design in 2001. Prior to that, Marman received a BA in Philosophy from the University of Western Ontario and Borins received a BA in Art History from McGill University.

Most are aware, when I exhibit a new body of work, that work is based on the extrapolation of an idea. And, as deep, and as varied in appearance as the /Plan for Painting Series/ are the working method applicable to their making is as programmatic as the method applied to the making of the /To Foil Oils/. At the structural level, a programmatic approach to the making of a group or series of paintings is a way of investigating the resonance of an idea through the convention of a serial format. Thus, the idea of realizing in a serial abstract paintings a multiplicity of mental perspective rooted to the specification of the medium through its relation to colour, material, and sensation provides viewers with the means to appreciate a rich and inexhaustible mother load of perception.

For example, Tomlin's abstract painting No. 12, 1952, oil on canvas, 66" x 48", collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo establishes two forms of perception that are fundamental to the development of abstract painting. That is, Tomlin by having painted a loose pattern of flat, white bars on top of a tight pattern of flat, coloured bars, usurps a previously claimed aesthetic space. Such a visual device entails viewers making distinctions about the difference between the elements that make up the narrow space if the painting. Together, these two principle forms of perception represent a balanced interrelation between the three components of abstract painting: the abstract, the real, and the symbolic.

Additionally, as in the /To Foil Oils/ the format remains essentially the same throughout the Plan for Paintings beginning with No. 24 through to No. 43. The only difference in format between the twelve works on exhibit varies regarding the four short, and four long strips of colour. Positioned in a clock-wise pattern those strips strife and converge with the other elements to create a multiplicity of concatenations of colour. And, those concatenations of colour are enhanced by the specific attributes of the concrete objective material properties of the hues. On that basis, a maximum pitch in the structure of the colour scheme can be realized through the intent to reveal explicitly - by virtue of the technical means - the sensations of the materials in association to the sensations of the colours.

Further, the Acrylics of the /Plan for Painting/ Series beginning with No. 24 objectively, and indidually represent different stages in the formation of a diverse range of unique colour schemes. That means a particular cycle of chromatic circumstances is made visible by maintaining a continuity throughout the series regarding its serial format. That, in combination with the technique of painting seventy-five Artists' Finity Acrylic Colours on what ostensibly looks like raw linen results in a wide variation in colour sensation and stage in the movement of colours results in a unique perceptual scheme. In addition, the formal components of the nine squares are comprised of a self-contained repetition of nine consecutive coloured strips complete the chromatic sequence. Lastly, the four short and four long coloured strips that follow the chromatic sequence, and the formal multiplicity of layered configuration of a particular scheme. In that, viewers are provided with the critical means to identity the extent of their subjective experience in relation to their self-conscious perception of the characteristic limit (s) of a particular work in the series.

The /Plan for Painting Series/ would not have been made possible without my having gone through the psychological process of perceiving an end in art as an end. That is to say, an end in art is not an end until it is perceived. Happily, a vulnerability in the emotional, and psychological content of the Plan for Paintings invite viewers to engage objects that are in effect visually addictive. Or encourage viewers to encompass, and embrace a visual process complimentary to their sustained anticipation of the work. Such an addiction to vision resides through viewers identifying with their aesthetic appreciation of the depth, and scope of perception contextualised by the conceptual, and plastic limits of abstract painting.

My art practice follows three increasingly interlaced avenues - video, web art, and public intervention. I have also begun to work in other media, such as drawing or photography, where conceptually appropriate. Much of my work is meant to be stumbled upon in everyday life and requires the participation of a very general audience.

In performance, I am interested in engaging with audiences as a means of orchestrating everyday activities away from their usual context, where audiences are made up of willing participants who are not necessarily expecting art. With a base largely made up of strangers I have shampooed hair in a salon, offered free advice, played games on the sidewalk, transformed borrowed clothing, sewed protective messages into people's clothing seams, brought plants into homes, and borrowed favourite objects for a month.

On the web, I am interested in obsession, poetics, identity, language, and pop-culture. Some of my work on the web is beginning to draw lines between digital and performative interactivity - web projects include an online advice lounge and an activist project advocating the 'dispersal and erradication' of English Ivy.

In video I am interested in absurd juxtapositions in popular and official American culture such as Charlton Hestons' appointment as President and spokesperson of the National Rifle Association; the language of U.S. Alien documentation; and my physical resemblance to a younger Meryl Streep. I am becoming increasingly interested in the cult of celebrity, and the desire that propels extreme fandom. My latest work is an ongoing conceptual project of which the object of my affection, actor Billy Bob Thornton, is the subject.

//The Virtual Library// is an installation of hand-made book works that offers a satirical reflection on the current status of "The Book" in western culture. The advent of virtual worlds of information has brought about a number of changes to the social and cultural practices that sustain the nature of book-based knowledge. For one, the relationship of the reader to the text has changed. So too have the material means through which the authority of the text is achieved. In fact the structures of a broad spectrum of processes, institutions and industries built upon the physical transmission and representation of knowledge have been affected by a technologically expanded information universe. In form and content, /The Virtual Library/ promotes reflection on the historical processes that underpin these transformations.

Produced between 1991 and 1997, the installation comprises a series of 22 volumes of the book of "Knowledge", and 47 individual book works, housed in two bookcases. Meant to simulate the scholarly tome, the book works are bound in leather with either cloth or hand-made cover-stock paper and their titles are embossed into the spine with gold leaf. The "library" furnishings have been designed to recall the neoclassical reading room. Large and overstated, the books and their cases favour the symbolic display of the values associated with these realms of knowledge over the accommodation of the subjects of that knowledge. By virtue of its particular content, however, this "library" directs the orientation of the viewer/reader away from the abstraction of the neoclassical ideal towards more material, immediate and concrete concerns. The books are made from the shredded fragments of one or more previously published books. The anarchistic juxtaposition of dissonant texts dramatically foregrounds the relationship between the reader and the work. Meaning is suspended in the dialectical confrontation between each of the original contents and their new forms: The reader provides the crucial link in this circuit of signification.

Hand made and labour intensive, the manner of my book works’ creation gives form and a very particular expression to what are otherwise invisible processes. The book work production begins with the physical dismantling of a "found" publication. Generally I use popular publications such as political biographies, popular historical narratives or how-to manuals, but sometimes I shred encyclopedias and scientific textbooks. The covers and bindings are removed and the pages are shredded, saving most illustrations intact. New sheets of paper are then formed with the paper maker’s mold and cotton pulp, which includes all these shredded fragments (and sometimes other ephemera such as straw, banknote and tinsel). The new pages are quite literally built out of the old. Appearing in a composition of random sentences and illustrations from diverse sources that are now unhinged, if not completely divorced, from their past manifestation, the original contents of the source book are radically transformed. The new book work’s title combines elements from the original publication to echo this effect. This relationship refers to the processes of cultural change where new technologies build upon the concepts and materials of past forms: The new does not so much efface the old, as selectively adapt critical elements of its multiple meanings and effects.

A first time collaboration between artist Fred McSherry and publisher Stéphane Danis, /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ is the most recent issue of Le muse secret, publishers of limited edition artist’s books and multiples exploring the taboo themes of sex, politics and religion. Modeled on the "pillow book", an early Asian diary form, this volume combines images and texts "borrowed" from high and popular cultural sources to test the presumed autonomy of moral, economic and aesthetic value systems.

Drawing inspiration from the Asian ideogram, /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ complicates the relationship between content and form. The bookwork is made using the remnants of other printed matter and selective found materials. Simultaneously it is about the way in which the ideas and material practices of diverse cultural phenomena converge. Bound in black linoleum tile, the finely textured pages of this publication blend cotton pulp with tinsel, shredded money, fragments of pages from the storybook Le petit prince and images downloaded from the Long Dong Silver Web site. Text fragments are interwoven and embossed into the handmade paper to literalize the idea of the concrete poem. Taking issue with the notion of critical distance, excerpts from Charles Baudelaire’s Mon coeur mis á nu are merged with ad copy stolen from the pages of a contemporary soft-core pornographic magazine. In his original story, Baudelaire used the binarism of naked/nude as an emblem of the hypocrisy of a bourgeois culture that separated private and public life. His own implication as a critic within this conflicted sphere was highly ambivalent. In this incarnation, the relationship between the critic, his objects and metaphors is more properly circumscribed.

The "narrative" of /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ is concerned with the interdependence of oppositional forms. Simultaneously rarified and stubbornly banal, the book’s very materiality directs its critical force. Form and content, image and text, high culture and low: all mutually dependent terms. As staged seductions give way to real desires, so too do the worlds of art and commerce converge.

Fred McSherry is a multi-media artist who has worked with sculpture, performance, video, installation and bookwork forms. Represented in numerous private and public collections, McSherry has exhibited his own work in solo and group exhibitions in diverse museums, galleries and cultural institutions in Canada and the USA. Over the past seven years McSherry has been building /The Virtual Library/, a collection of seventy one-of-a-kind artist’s books that use the same techniques as those employed in /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ to explore the role of the book in the production of popular knowledge.

An art collector, art historian, teacher and book designer, Stéphane Danis is the publisher of Editions S. Danis and /Le muse secret/, producers of limited edition artist’s books and multiples. Represented in numerous private and public collections, Danis’s books have been exhibited in libraries and museums across North America. He has published /Reliqui/ with Carlos Quiroz (1996), /Dix muse secrets/ (1996) and /La Dchirure/ with Jacques Lamoureux (1993), and /Curio/ with Irene Whittome (1994).

*1916* offers an historical reflection of the world at war. Comprising a series of paintings and etchings made 'after' photographs and posters from WWI, the project considers the individual contributions and collective ideologies that underwrite global conflict, then and now.

The paintings and some of the etchings rework photographic portraits of groups of military personnel from different countries involved in WWI; to date portraits from Canada, the USA, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Belgium, India, Nepal and Italy have been completed. In each of these works special attention is paid to the individual parts that make up the whole: unique faces, and stances separate the one from the many, the individual from the group. Just as differences within each order are made apparent, similarities in circumstances from one to the other come to the fore. Regardless of personal belief or particular situation all participants are in harm's way, all are at war.

The balance of the series of etchings points to the ideological productions supporting war efforts. The series is divided into various groupings beginning with: (a) diverse collections of soldiers and officers; (b) monarchs and political leaders; (c) avant-garde artists and organizations; (d) future leaders; (e) thematic groupings of war propaganda from opposing powers.

This last set is derived from war posters which share and reflect many of the same representational tropes and historically specific political biases and cultural beliefs.

While these works are focused on the social and cultural mechanisms underwriting the First World War, they are nonetheless relevant in relation to international conflict today. The retrospective look allows a long view of the nationalist and heroic rationalizations fueling the engines of war.

These paintings happened in a funny way...

I went to the Varley Museum to see an exhibition of work by the Painters Eleven.

They were all the rage around the time that I was born. Like the fins on a '59 Chrysler, they were the future. And then they kind of disappeared. Or maybe it was that promise of the modern world that seemed to vanish.

After the show, I returned home to paint.

The paintings in my exhibition straddle an area between representation and abstraction. Unlike representation, they begin their lives as a series of completely random markings made from brush loads of left over paint from prior works. Yet as they evolve, they seem to suggest a figure/ground relationship. Unlike abstraction, a narrative becomes implied. Like the "new kid in the school yard", the paintings are inhabited by strange figures trying to adapt to the new world that they find themselves in.

These paintings want to move. Their rhythm is that of theAM radio. They shake and jiggle and they can't keep their legs still. They chug and clank like the trains on the railway tracks of my youth. They spin quietly like the inner workings of a wrist watch. They're Professor Longhair and Hank Williams talkin' bout the latest Beach Boys record. They are the colour of billboards, shopping bags and old factories. They are the colour of pop cans and plastic shoes. Floating on the surface are the leftover bits of shapes, carved out by my brush - like pop ups on a computer screen, like the flotsam and jetsam of old sputniks and appolos coursing through space. They're constantly squabbling. The ordered and the messy jostling for supremacy. These paintings are like siblings stuck in the back seat on a long summer drive: They draw invisible lines, defining impervious boundaries between each other, broached easily by wandering fingers.

These paintings are about my childhood and that adult yearning to taste the sweet gummy bears of nostalgia for a time that no longer exists. These paintings are about the past, smeared with a patina of the present, trying to recreate that same feeling of promise for a utopian future.

My work employs both photography and painting in the production of a distinct body of work. The resulting images exhibit characteristics of photography as an expression and poetic medium - a recording device of the 'real' - while at the same time addressing painting as a dimension to express and record the emotional states and memories of the inner (subconscious) world. The images of my art production are not literal or linear in structure, but are constructed from fragmented and repetitive pieces, and represent a narrative of time, place, and memory. The work attempts to question how these histories and images live in our conscious and unconscious memories and affect our ways of seeing and perception of reality. In this way, my work questions history, the construction of time as a linear process, and the distinction between history (external body) and memory (internal body) in the process of defining identity.

In this exploration the issue of identity is seen as an ongoing dialogue between the interior and the exterior, the private and the public, the imagined and the real, the poetic and the profane. Sited within languages of visual communication (paint, photography, and installation) this work intends to give expression to these forces in an effort to traverse the space between the interior and exterior projections of the body.

The interface between the inner and the outer selves is the 'skin' - the porous membrane through which the body's inner reality rises to the surface, and the external world is absorbed and internalized. The painted or photographic surface, as visual language, is analogous to this dimension of communication from the interior and exterior body.

Metaphorically, I see painting as being representative of the interior / emotional body, while the photography speaks of the exterior / physical body. The hand, as mediator to the act of painting, can be seen as a metaphor for the sensual body, while the traces of photography are the tools by which the conscious body finds expression in the outer world. By using photographs and by desiring to paint them, I am breathing life back into these images - I am giving back to memories of time and place the aura and mystery that has been lost in the photograph. My desire to paint my photography is actually a desire to authenticate or make unique a world that is fragmented and overexposed in the photographic image.

This exhibition attempts to question how what we see and perceive is affected by the histories and images that live in our conscious and unconscious memories. Time and physical being are explored by Sarah Nind in paysages fragiles through a personal inventory of collected imagery, including images of environmental destruction from the artist's birth place in South-East Asia. The artist uses photographs, developed on a photo-sensitized mylar sheet (ortholith film), and painted with oil paints.

"I am breathing life into these images - I am giving back memories of time and place the aura and mystery that has been lost in the memory," says the artist. She continues to describe how her desire to paint her photographs "is actually a desire to authenticate or make unique a world that is fragmented and overexposed in the photographic image." Her manipulation of the original images from Sarah's archive of photographs allow her to reinterpret and distance herself from the personal, and "open the work to the viewer for a unique authoring of the trace with which individual identity is defined."

I try to make my art visually uplifting and spiritually positive. I aim to extend the traditional language of painting through my own vision, intuition and invention.

My painting follows from that of Miro, Pollock, Louis, Frankenthaler and Poons. By exploring the fluid forms of painting, images or motifs are derived from the painting process itself. The process of layering fluid colour and opening the surfaces to reveal colour enables me to compose my images. The topographical separations in the paint, dubbed /crazing/, have many associations with natural organisms - like the opening of the earth's surface or magnified biological cells - reflecting the behavior of the paint itself. I select, edit, collage, crop and undulate the surfaces of the shapes to create the necessary tension, balance and unity in the formal character of the works.

I do not attempt to illustrate ideas but rather to discover the sensory associations contained in the paint matter with which I work; as Cezanne or Monet did in front of a landscape. I too paint from nature, but my subject is a self portrait of my experience with the nature of painting itself. The external reality or landscape is reflected in the paint formations.

Although abstract art is sometimes criticized as being purely formal and lacking content, it remains for me a vital and sensory art form. I do not believe that form can exist without association or ideological content. Without inventive and unified form there is no art at all. Quality has never been dependant on stylistic orientation, figuration or abstraction. Goya, Manet, Matisse, Leger, Miro, Hoffman and Pollock are all quite different, but all made their art by formal, expressive and original means. I intend to continue this challenge.

/The Tibetans/ is a portfolio of photographs from late 1995. For ten years I have documented threatened world cultures: the Tuaregs or Blue Men of the Sahara Desert, the Nubians in southern Egypt and the Maya in Chiapas, Mexico. Yet, I believe, in The Tibetans, I have assembled the photographs that best represent the spirit of an unsettled world culture.

These images show the Tibetans' sense of survival that has continued in spite of the past 45 years of Chinese occupation and official genocide. The Tibetans is a testament to a people's strength of character and their love of life in spite of overwhelming odds. The political voice behind these images is the affirmation of human dignity and the condemnation of cultural oppression.

At the center of each Tibetan's life stands his or her unfaltering belief in Buddhism. Many of my photographs are taken in the monasteries of Tibet where the monks currently are rebuilding their religious communities following the destruction of over 6,000 of their monasteries by Chinese troops. /The Tibetans/ documents the living continuation of one of the most enigmatic and artistic world cultures, that of Tibetan Buddhism.

As with all of my photographs of unsettled world communities, /The Tibetans/ are black-and-white prints meant to capture the timeless isolation of a unique world culture. Many of these images have a dark and somber presence as they were taken inside the mysterious candle-lit sanctuaries of Tibet's Buddhist monasteries.

In the year of my birth Jackson Pollock created his first 'drip' paintings; Bell Lab Scientists invented the transistor; a UFO dropped out of the sky over Roswell, New Mexico; Henry Ford died; Chuck Yaeger broke the sound barrier at Mach One; and Tupperware was introduced to the North American household. Later, I studied and graduated from university with Donna Reed, Bill Bailey, Nancy Davis, Margaret Mitchell and Henry Miller.

Fundamental changes have a rhythm with which mankind has become familiar over the ages. Man gradually adapts. By accident man invented history; he wrote in the style of inventory and visualized his histories through art. He accumulated, incorporated and orchestrated. His world became regular and predictable.

I am concerned with historical dislocation, the break in the sense of connection which man has long felt with the vital and nourishing symbols of cultural traditions.

Leopold Plotek’s titles invoke antiquity, scripture, mythology, Jewish mysticism, and Artie Shaw-and electic list that parallels the wide-ranging pictorial allusions of his mysterious, audacious paintings. Plotek aspires to the drama, seriousness, and sensuousness of the Venetian Renaissance and the High Baroque, ambitions that these days are usually synonymous with postmodernist irony and appropriation. The Montreal based Plotek, however, neither quotes verbatim nor updates historical compositions. Instead, he strives to invent in his own abstract language the qualities of past art that he admires-he casts the Grand Manner into late-20th-century terms and he filters the highest of high art through high modernism, all with street smart overtones.

Murky, hot color, lush paint handling, and dry, broken surfaces trigger associations with Venetian prototypes without reproducing them. Space is unstable; "foreground" and "background" change places. Figures, gestures, even narratives are implied but not depicted-sometimes, a human presence survives as just a memory.

In The Trip Here and Back, Plotek wrenches a vertiginous dream image of Italy out of a loose structure of dully glowing planes. Evocative shapes briefly pull free and then subside. A tall, slender tower turns a dark, luminous expanse into sky, arcades evoke the sheltered streets of Bologna, and something vaguely figurelike lurks in a corner, yet the painting remains essentially abstract. Plotek’s approach is a high-risk proposition, but when he succeeds-as he often does-this artist achieves resonant, disquieting images that both demand and reward sustained attention.

Printmaker George Raab has gained an international reputation for his wilderness landscape etchings. His intaglio images are made by creating grooves and textures below the surface of zinc or copper plates. The techniques he uses most frequently are etching, aquatinting, photo etching, and watercolour painting. In etching, primarily used to create lines, the surface of the plate is covered with a liquid acid-resistant ground. Tools are used to draw through the dried ground so that when immersed in an acid bath, the exposed metal is bitten. Aquatinting is a tonal process. Rosin powder is fused using heat to selected bare sections of the plate and the resulting acid bite creates an even texture. In both these methods, the longer the exposure to the acid, the darker the area will appear in the print. In photo etching, a manipulated monochromatic photographic negative is enlarged onto litho film. It is then reworked by scratching out areas and adding to the image by drawing directly on the film with India ink. The litho film is then contacted onto the sensitized metal plate and hand worked below the surface using the preceding techniques, some of which date back to the 16th Century. The plate is cleaned, hand inked and wiped for each printing. The ink fills in wherever the metal has been disturbed. Prints are pulled on damp rag paper, which is subjected to the great pressure of a manually operated printing press. Some of the resulting images are then hand watercoloured.

"The wilderness is a constant source of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration to me. I turn to these unspoiled areas for a sense of peace and solace. All of my work is dedicated to interpreting the visual harmony of our natural heritage. Printmaking, my chosen medium is very indirect and elusive. My original etchings are varying combinations of drawing, etching, aquatinting, photography, and painting. Each medium has something to say and I never know exactly what it is until I peel the print away from the plate. There are always surprises. These original intaglio prints are personal and patriotic statements celebrating one of our greatest assets: our natural environment. They portray the subtle and inspiring wilderness in less well-known areas of Canada and the United States. My work touches a common chord of familiarity amongst viewers. There is a sense of primal longings, seasonal changes, and the mystery of the wild lands we need in order to better know ourselves."

From the catalogue for Rayner's /Retrospective/ at The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, January 10 - February 21, 1979.

In becoming an artist, I believe my environment mattered most: it's whom you're emulating and what you're surrounded by. I was surrounded by art. Over the mantelpiece at home I remember a large, exquisite watercolour about three feet high, absolutely naturalistic and beautifully done by my father. It was a portrait of Anna May Wong, the thirties movie star you may remember from /Shanghai Express/. My grandfather was also an artist. He painted public school rooms in Toronto, green on the bottom and cream on the top. On weekends he painted memories of English landscapes, tiny canvases with all the leaves on all the trees and all the wool on the backs of all the sheep lying where every blade of grass was clearly defined. My great grandfather was a Squire in Yorkshire, made fine furniture and painted after the style of Turner. My great uncle's paintings hung in the Royal Academy.

When I was little, about three years old, I lived in the Pall Mall apartments on Yonge Street, in what would now be considered an Art Deco building with its curved corners and rounded windows. My father, Gordon Wesley Rayner, worked as a commercial artist, so there were lots of art supplies around; big pads of paper, pastels, and commercial artists' tempera paints, not the junk they made us use in school. Because of this I got a sense of the quality of good materials. It wasn't so much 'Gordon, you're a bad boy, go stand in the corner,' or 'Go to your room;' it was more a matter of 'Go somewhere and paint a picture.'

My father used to work at home in the evenings. There was a tilt drawing table in the kitchen. It was as much a part of the furniture as the chesterfield suite that he designed. In fact, my father designed much of the furniture in the apartment.

My mother always respected my father in somewhat the same way as I did: I found him heroic, almost a mythological figure. I remember that the big pinstriped Chicago-gangster pants he used to wear always had coins jingling in them, a sound that would have been at ear level when I stood up straight.

My father served his apprenticeship at Rapid Grip and Batten with Jack Bush. They were close friends and, though they apparently had a personal schism when I was young, they maintained a great respect for one another's work. After all, they were two of the best illustrators to come out of that generation. Shortly after my father's apprenticeship, he started his own business, Art Circle Ltd., and became well known as a first-class figure man. It was a small company in the penthouse of a great old building near the Stock Exchange on Bay Street. It's gone now, but had gold embellishments and a European-style elevator. At about the age of eight or nine I began visiting him there on Saturday afternoons (my parents were divorced by then) and I often brought a friend along from my neighbourhood. We'd make our own newspapers, because my father had a typewriter, an amazing machine for a boy. I'd take over a whole office desk on a Saturday when the staff wasn't there, with just my father and maybe a lettering man around, hitting those deadlines.

I'd make my newspapers, pecking away at the typewriter about what happened in my district or what happened when I went swimming the day before. We'd always need headlines and my father would come over and letter them in. they were really fantastic pieces because they were all rubbed out and had spelling mistakes and paste-in changes. Actually, this was my introduction to typography, layout and design. I cut out pictures from real newspapers and put them in mine; I suppose these could be considered my first collages, although I wouldn't have known the word then.

With my father and his younger brother, my Uncle Harold, there was always an emphasis on the natural life, the bush, the animal world, fishing, wood lore, the ways of the Indians. The first books my father gave me were Ernest Seton Thompson books on how to survive in the bush, such as /Two Little Indians/ and /Wild Animals I Have Known/. North Toronto (Eglinton and Yonge), in what is now thick city, was surrounded by wild country. My uncle, who is also a commercial artist and a painter, made the most exquisite bows and arrows by hand. He taught me how to shoot and we'd lie in the snow with our bows for hours waiting for a rabbit to come out of its hole. There were even grouse and pheasants around then. We'd take the day's kill back to my grandfather's house and have roast pheasant for dinner. My uncle would use the quill feathers for arrow foils. There was a great sense of the land, wilderness, respect for animals, and what is now broadly referred to as eulogy.

After Yonge Street, I lived on Keewatin Avenue, a cul-de-sac that backed on a Jewish cemetery. At its end was what we called 'Sherwood Forest,' completely untouched wild bush. I had real bows and arrows but I was trained not to shoot friends or other animals out of season. I learned to keep my hunting knife sharp, build a good campfire, and tell one owl from another. We'd go out at night, sit silently in the bush and listen for an owl. I used to come home with quart baskets full of fresh watercress every spring from the little stream that flowed through there. Now the stream is polluted and the forest is a landscaped park.

Looking back, it seems the men in my childhood were constantly using their hands at one skill or another, while the women made magic in the kitchen. I lived with my mother, whom I love dearly. She was a true beauty, full of life, ebullient and always tolerant of my slipping in and out of her life at breakneck speeds. When I was eight she married a Toronto fireman, Frank Nash; unfortunately we didn't get along with each other. He wanted me to be a fireman. My ambition to be an artist made it impossible for both of us. By this time it was 1943 and my father had remarried. At age twelve, I took a matriculation year at Northern Vocational High and failed. I had been a bright kid in public school, skipped grades and was a top athlete. But by age fourteen I was running away from home. I also started to get interested in the phenomenon called girls and fell desperately in love regularly, not to mention sneaking drinks out of the liquor cabinet, and spending more and more of my free time at the local restaurant hangout, Chum's, where I was a hit because I could draw caricatures of my friends. Chum's was run by a one-armed Chinese man who kept a baseball bat under the counter. We'd sneak cheap rye into our lemon cokes and dressed in black satin Eisenhower jackets with zippers from the left hip to the right shoulder. We wore ducktail hairdos and green strides with canary yellow out seams that had forty-four inch knees, thirteen-inch cuffs and drop-loop gun pockets. A long furnace chain usually hung down to the floor with a shiv on the end of it. Add to this style a Sammy Taft hat and a long black Benny overcoat and you'll recognize the period. We were walking Al Capp cartoons. And we danced almost every night. You'd find us at school tea dances, or Catholic Church dances. We'd do the dirty boogie, the Fallingbrook Balmy. We'd go out to the Canoe Club in the East End, dance, drink beer and fight over girls. I can't remember anyone ever getting really hurt.

By the time I was fifteen, having flunked my first year in high school, my parents gave in. They took the position that art would at least give me a vocation. I loved art, I loved science, and I loved working in the carpentry and machine shops - all that satisfying uses of hands, putting it together, the building of things. As for my academic education, I continuously read and studied those subjects that obsessed me most.

I did well in the art course at Northern Vocational. Robert Short was my teacher. Over the years he's been an important influence on a lot of artists who emerged from that school. He was one of the first so-called liberal art teachers in that he encouraged students to experiment. For my generation this was extremely rare. I also remember Mrs. Curry, a sculpture teacher, who was something of a tyrant. But when I got my hands into clay and started mucking around, she softened and I learned a lot from her. Rodin was a particular enthusiasm of hers at a time when the Board of Education wouldn't have approved.

Because of an incident, which involved our gang vandalizing the school, I was expelled. This ominous turn of events embarrassed and hurt my parents. I am neither ashamed nor proud of it. I only mention it because it led to a complete change of the utmost importance in my early life. I was put into the hands of my father and went to his studio downtown. Art Circle had been dissolved and he had gone with Bomac Engravers as an independent illustrator. He also worked solo as a freelancer. I worked in his studio from nine to five doing lettering samples for three weeks. I loved it because it was like being grown up. Throughout my early teens my father taught me technique and I was getting more and more interested in art. By then I had decided I wanted to be a commercial artist. I had no real sense of fine art, even though there were paintings and reproductions around my father's apartment and he painted part-time. I wanted to do work that was partially abstract, like the jazz album covers by David Stone Martin. The na�ve dream of every young artist then was to do a cover for the Saturday Evening Post; not necessarily like Norman Rockwell, but of that quality.

The ritual then was to go out with your sample kit to job interviews and become a junior apprentice in an engraving house or an advertising agency. All this time I thought that my father, well known with lots of connections, would get me a job. The bright thing he did (though I didn't think so then) was to tear out three yellow pages listing Commercial Art Houses, hand them to me, and say 'Take your samples, start with "A", and walk.' So I did. Three pages later, at the very bottom, I landed a job with a company called Wookey, Bush and Winter. In the old puritan ethical way, I had learned a lesson. I found myself working with Les Wookey, a marvelous designer, Jack Bush, whom we all know, and Bill Winter, the charming painter of children. /What an opportunity!/ I answered the phone, delivered parcels, and cleaned water bowls every morning. I was at the office before they were, made the coffee according to their wishes, cleaned out the ash trays and got used to saying, 'Good morning, Wookey, Bush and Winter.' I was of no use to them whatsoever except in this capacity. I was incapable of doing anything near their quality of commercial work at that time. When my duties were done, I was supposed to sit and practice.

Generous men, they paid me eighteen dollars a week to start, which was more than a fair salary for what they received in return. Wookey, Bush and Winter were to become semi-heroes in my life. I'd wander into Jack Bush's office, for example, and he'd be doing Harvey Wood's underwear ads for men and women, and we'd talk of the importance of drawing as the basis of all art. He experimented with different paints that were coming out at the time. Sometimes I'd stand for hours behind him, while he chewed gum trying to quit smoking, watching him do these marvelous illustrations. He'd talk and I'd ask questions. Once he put down his brush and said to me, 'Young Gord, if you are going to be an artist you must think of art all the time, it must be uppermost in your mind, you must rediscover your eyes, even when they are sleeping you must be looking!' I'd become bolder as time went by, learning the technical aspects of commercial art, all that it entails - printing processes, colour separations, what photographs can do, how to cut mats instead of fingers. All the while practicing, /practicing/. They gave me a raise to twenty dollars a week after the first year and allowed me to do bits and pieces in their ads: a little lettering, a little over-lay painting - which was encouraging. I started to wear suits. I was nearly eighteen and sophisticated enough to listen to a little classical music.

But even when I was fifteen I was somewhat outside my contemporaries because of an interest in jazz: Louis Armstrong, the Hot Five, Django Rhinehart. Bush was also a great jazz fan. Elvis wasn't around then, but I liked that kind of music too. Rock and roll existed in its roots under the name of R and B. I started to listen to the classics and broadened my scope with music as I was broadening my scope with experiencing the world of art.

In 1953 I would occasionally be asked to work late in order to serve drinks to a strange and gregarious group of people who congregated in Jack Bush's office. They loved to yell and scream at each other. I actually saw one of them, Harold Town I think, rolling around on the floor with Oscar Cahen indulging in fake fisticuffs. They must have been having fun. /Pugilistic possums/. They were the Painters Eleven. Little did I know the historical significance of these formative gatherings. During this period, Jack was changing from naturalistic art to abstract art, which of course had an enormous effect on me. It was an extremely exciting time though I was full of doubts about it, and about totally abstract art in particular - it had never been seen in Toronto. Shortly thereafter I left and got a better job, on Jack's advice. He said, 'You're finished your apprenticeship here and now you've got to get out into the world and start making some money, and some art.' I got another job for something like thirty dollars a week doing lettering and silkscreen posters. The members of Painters Eleven never said much to me beyond, 'Get me another drink, will you boy!' They had the door closed. But I heard rumbles and mumbles as they wrote, wrestled with the group statement for their first exhibition announcement; and talked in a new exciting code, with words such as 'non-objective,' 'action-painting,' 'stream of conscious,' and 'abstract!' At that time Tom Hodgson was one of the youngest, most brilliant painters.

I'd started to paint more and more on my own. My works were still illustrations, but they started to get expansive and more experimental. I was living alone in a studio. I had left home and had a little garret. I previously painted imitation Van Gogh's and I took my new work back to Jack Bush for critiques. I know now that the works were atrocious. Bush gave me great advice, while at the same time encouraging and confusing me. He said, 'Take a look at the work of this young guy, Tom Hodgson, and paint like that.' I said, 'I don't want to copy anybody.' He replied, 'You paint like that now, because you're not going to for long, you've got to break through; you don't know what you're doing; Tom is young, like you.' (Tom is a little older than me but not all that much, and he has kept a unique youthful vitality in his work to this day.) Bush said, 'You're a young guy, paint like you are!' So I did. I took him literally and went and checked out all the Tom Hodgson paintings that were at Roberts Gallery. I'd never met Tom; he was already a practicing designer and an illustrator. So I started to do a few 'Tom Hodgsons'.

In 1956 the movie Lust for Life with Anthony Quinn and Kirk Douglas came out. Moulin Rouge had appeared before it in 1952. This had to be it. If you're a commercial artist you've got deadlines; it was the day of the grey flannel suit. I was still working at commercial art, doing more design, layout, lettering, developing a cartoon style for TV animation. But I realized that I wanted to do more insane things than applied art allowed. I'd never really got along with the bosses. I never really liked getting up early in the morning. I never liked deadlines. So I began the syndrome of painting into the early morning hours. Because of Life magazine Bernard Buffet was a hit. It was easy to emulate that stuff.

The first exhibition I had was in the upstairs lobby of the now-defunct Odeon Toronto movie house at College and Yonge. About this time, I met Dennis Burton and because of his studies at the Ontario College of Art I became friends with a variety of young artists including Robert Markle, Rick Gorman, Marlene Markle and Larisa Pavelchenko who were all in the same year at the college. I was fascinated by children's art, certainly a different world of vision than that studied at O.C.A., and the art of Paul Klee. Klee and Ben Shahn, my other influence then, had something in common in a graphic sense. Shahn was another artist tempting to imitate, especially as I had had training in the graphic arts. Once you fell in love with Ben Shahn's work you just had to follow his lines. Half the people I knew at that time were doing Ben Shahn. When I met Graham Coughtry a couple of years later he was a Ben Shahn expert. When I met him I asked him, 'What do you think of Paul Klee?' He said, 'See that guy over there, he's a Paul Klee expert, go and talk to him.' The person he was speaking of was Mike Snow, who was influenced in his early work by Klee. By this time, 1955-56, Burton, Robert Smith and I shared the upstairs loft in an old Victorian house called the Villa Crispin. We talked incessantly about art, music, and women. One thing that brought Burton and I together as close friends is that we were both jazz fanatics. We also had a mutual interest in classically based music, and the stirrings of a form called electronic music. Anything that was new, or unfamiliar, would be debated. It was during this time that I learned a great deal about historically traditional art through self-imposed study. I used to take what we called 'The Ontario College of Art Lessons,' from Dennis Burton; that is, the exercises he received as homework from teachers such as Fred Hagan. I'd never heard of things like flattened perspective before. Burton literally taught me. I'd ask him and he's explain it. Also I had the advantage of seeing his expert examples. He was a fantastic student. He won several prizes at the school. Despite some tough arguments there was never any animosity. We were, however, branching away from one another, as our individual styles began to develop, slowly, surely. I went through a period of Rico Le Brun influence that came through Dennis. I found out later that Robert Hedrick (whom I hadn't yet met) had studied with Le Brun in Mexico. Dennis studied with him in California. The facts leave a web that would make a marvelous graph if someone could ever put it together. About that time Painters Eleven mounted a major show at Hart House. Burton and I attended enthusiastically. What knocked me out were Bill Ronald's paintings. There were two or three of them - they burned into my brain. I didn't like Jack Bush's paintings then; they seemed awkward. The Tom Hodgson's were impressive, but to a lesser degree. I couldn't understand the work of Hortense Gordon but Alexandra Luke's work evoked a certain tingle.

After seeing the show Burton and I turned on our heels, hurried back to the Villa Crispin into our individual studios, and did our first 'giant' abstract paintings, probably on four-foot pieces of masonite. They were somewhat similar and Ronald-like. Did we feel good! Somehow, there was some kind of relief. Still, for months, or maybe years, we were quietly nervous about the significance of such work - 'is abstraction really art?' - that kind of question. We always argued and discussed it. One night two senior painters, Cleeve Horne and R. York Wilson, came to visit. They were fantastic, so generous, genuinely interested and so encouraging. They had spent the evening priming pieces of masonite for their own work, and took it upon themselves to see what the young pups were up to. They talked for hours. They looked at our work, and never said anything negative (though I'm sure they must have thought it) but somehow managed to say 'keep going'. They were kind human beings, not authoritarian Victorian squashers.

I was invited to Cleeve Horne's studio to meet his wife, Jean, who, much to my surprise, had a welding sculpture studio. Turns out she was the first person in the country working with welded steel. She said, 'Do you want some of that?' 'Sure do.' She said, 'Go to night school and learn how to weld and then come back.' I went back to Northern Vocational High and took the plumbers' night course. I left after the first six weeks, as soon as I got a good bead. I knew how to weld. I went back to her and she let me use her studio. I did my first few pieces in welded steel. She helped me a great deal.

Around this time I got a place of my own and worked on Yonge Street below Bloor over a second-hand shoe store. I sculpted in steel out on the roof much to the landlord's dismay and made a large mess and a small sculpture. It was the first work that I know of that was accepted into an Ontario Society of Artists exhibition at the Art Gallery of Toronto, the first piece of steel sculpture by a Canadian to be shown there. It was suspended from the ceiling. Then I started to work larger. I made a thirteen-foot fountain that actually functioned for Elise Meltzer's garden pool in Rosedale. I was sure I was a great sculptor when my fountain was installed in place of the pissing cherub. To walk into her house and almost literally trip over a Henry Moore, the first one I'd really seen, was an unforgettable experience.

By now I was sure about the significance of abstract art. Dennis Burton, Ross Mendes and I went to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and we saw our first New York originals. Burton said, 'De Kooning! You can't do that. Everything I've been taught says you can't do that.' I said, 'But Denny, he did it.' I'd never seen a Mark Rothko before except in reproductions. There was one at the end of a hall and Mendes turned to me and said, 'You know, I think I could walk up to that and put my arm into it up to the shoulder.' Those kinds of reflex actions are still valid today; they're very moving experiences. I also saw my first real Jackson Pollocks, my first Clyfford Stills, and the paintings of the great master Hans Hoffman. There was a Francis Bacon; a very good painting, quite moving, but for some reason, it didn't have that slam effect that the Americans did. Too melodramatic. The only thing it had going for it (and for his work in general to this day) is that it was nicely painted in an almost American way, but the subject matter was terribly illustrative of emotions rather than revealing the emotions themselves.

By this time I was living at 18 _ St. Mary Street, another old Victorian building split up into apartments, which is now some dull high-rise, and through Ross Mendes I met Al Fleming, a great designer who loved paintings and reminded me that it was possible, even maybe a responsibility, for artists to love all art forms as long as they were excellently executed. When Ross saw I was doing steel sculpture he introduced me to Gerry Gladstone who had also begun to work in steel, and we would talk all night long and longer. We'd have jam sessions. I was playing drum brushes on the back of beer cases, Gladstone was playing flute, Coughtry was singing the blues and Mike Snow was already playing brilliant piano. This music has been more of a social tie than our private art. We always had that in common, the fun, the gatherings; not when we were alone struggling in studios, but when we got together at those great parties: people pounding garbage cans (they were metal in those days) and singing the blues.

In my paintings, the big change came after that Albright-Knox show. The Painters Eleven exhibition prior to that had caused a major alteration in my work from natural imagery to abstraction, and the confirmation of those ideas became resolved through the Albright-Knox abstract expressionist show, trips to New York City, and then much more study through reproductions. We were the art magazine fans of the world; we all had subscriptions to /Art News/. We read every page and discussed it all. De Kooning was my favourite artist at the time. Before I had reached this stage both /Time/ and /Life/ magazines came out with spreads on Jackson Pollock. I was infuriated. I was certain this wasn't art. I was ready to picket with a banner in front of The Museum of Modern Art saying 'You're being fooled,' but I was intelligent enough to realize that if I was going to fight against this aberration I had to know my facts, accumulate ammunition. So I started really to study it, read about it, went to Buffalo to see it. Within one year, I was a complete convert. I had become the number one de Kooning fan in the world not realizing there were only about 50,000 artists in the U.S. doing second-string de Koonings. I even did a series of paintings that were of women grinning with big teeth. What really happened, of course, was that by emulating so literally the de Kooning techniques I learned an enormous amount in a very short time. But I was just realizing that there wasn't enough /Rayner/ in my work. The only difference was that I had left-handed instead of right-handed brush strokes. So, I consciously tried to break with the de Kooning influence while trying to maintain the essence of everything I'd learned. One way to break was to look more deeply and thoroughly into other artists' work. My paintings started to get gentler.

Around this time Barry Kernerman opened the Gallery of Contemporary Art, and came to my studio. He was looking for young blood; I was very nervous. He said, 'Those great big women you are painting are de Koonings.' I said, 'How did you know?' By this time, however, I'd already started to edge away from this overwhelming influence and consciously ask myself who I was, what were my particular interests. Instead of painting large angry women, what about still life? What about the north? The land? Where's your sense of humour?

The north to me had always been a place I visited for purposes other than painting. I thought the north, if it was to be painted, should be painted like the Group of Seven. Barns were to be painted in the manner of Syd Hallam or my father. Barry Kernerman picked out one of my newer pieces, and put it in the show. He generously put one of the semi-de Kooning things in too. Meanwhile, around the corner was The Greenwich Gallery where Av Isaacs was then building a stable. He already had Gerald Scott, Mike Snow, Gerry Gladstone, Graham Coughtry, and Robert Vavarande. My friend Coughtry recommended me to Av, so he came to see my work and said, 'I've got another young person I 'd like to show, so I think it might be an idea to have a two-person show.' The other person was Joyce Wieland. So, when I was twenty-three, I had an exhibition with Joyce Wieland at The Greenwich Gallery.

At that time, I lived in the Rosedale valley, with my wife and daughter. My life was like a soft-focus French film with statues leaning in greenery, trees full of raccoons and my child's record player playing jazz. I was painting all night and commercial-arting all day. I was awarded my first Canada Council grant, thanks to Harold Town's recommendation. Then a most significant change happened in my life. I'd been to Europe once before, when I was twenty, and had taken the train from Paris down to Ibiza to visit Graham Coughtry. This time I went with my wife and my daughter, Daphne, to Germany to meet my in-laws. We went to the Louvre and, via the Prado in Madrid, to Morocco. Most of the time was spent painting in a tiny house in the Balearic Islands. We lived for a year, quite well, on $2,500. Then I had to come back, give up this fantasy life, find a job, find a place to live, pay the rent and all that. By then I was spending more and more time staying up at night painting, and started to lose jobs. The truth is I started to not care about the jobs. There wasn't the slightest doubt in my mind that I was going to make it as an artist, and I was going to be a full-time professional by the time I was thirty. I wanted to be able to give up advertising art, not to have to work that way for a living. Although I had and still have the utmost respect for fine designers and illustrators, I was aware that the painting of certain artists suffered because of commercial art influences: the fashionable tricks of the hand, the clich?s. I could see it, and I didn't want it. I got out by the time I was twenty-nine. When I was thirty Robert Markle and I were approached by Dennis Burton, Robert Hedrick, and John Syme. They wanted us to teach; something I'd said I would never do, nervous that teaching would drain the energies directed toward my own work. They had started a new art school in 1965 and proposed a method of teaching that was very enticing. We were told we could teach art in any way we cared. Markle and I said we'd try it for a year. It was also additional income. After all, we hadn't much from living off freelance work.

Few of our paintings were being sold. Av Isaacs, friends and wives helped, but it was a financial juggling act. To my surprise and delight, teaching invigorated me and the close association with dedicated young artists kept me from becoming insular; it forced me to verbalize ideas and ideals that otherwise might have remained foggy and vague. It was during the early teaching days that my obsession with the Ontario North took hold.

During my early to mid-twenties, while shedding the de Kooning influence, I started to spend more time up in the Magnetawan district near Parry Sound. I came to the realization that for the last decade I'd been reacting against the small oil-on-masonite paintings of barns, bush, ponds, rivers, and streams that I'd done with my father in the early days. I re-examined the significance of the northern landscape, and realized that there was a subject there for me. It had been in front of me all this time and was yet another means of getting away from the self-consciously urban paintings that the Abstract Expressionists were doing. Franz Kline was inspired by the Brooklyn Bridge, and de Kooning was inspired by the peeling green and pink wallpaper of the old buildings on Tenth Street in Manhattan. Mark Rothko, the more mystical of the group, was still urban in substance.

It was during this time that I began to do more work up north in Charlie's cabin, an isolated hunt camp, once owned by Charlie Clifton. His father bought the land in the twenties after the loggers were done with it. They took out all the virgin growth, the giant trees, but then it was growing again. I first went there with my mother and stepfather when I was between the ages of seven and ten years old, and the place hasn't changed a bit. There's an almost impenetrable three-mile road; you can't get a car in very often, it's that muddy and wrecked. I had to get a case of beer, a block of ice, a bag of groceries and a lady on the back of my motorcycle and get in there. That's another reason why it's virtually untouched. Unfortunately, there are more and more canoe trips coming down the river and the cabins are being broken in to.

Now I do two kinds of painting. The first is a kind of citified, urban painting, more cerebral, less influenced by my actual surroundings. In other words, I'm neither painting nor influenced directly by the back alleys of Spadina Avenue. But when I'm up north my palette changes automatically and the method by which I paint changes, the aspects of touch and colour are more affected by the environment. I began to paint the peculiar light that exists only in northern Ontario. Part of the lure of the north is its strange Pre-Cambrian light and the reflection off the thousands of lakes that exist there and the jungle-like growth. The sky is, even in the hilly country up there and with the density of the bush, overwhelming. I'm sure these features were major attractions for the Group of Seven. As for those members that went to the Rockies, Fred Varley and Arthur Lismer, their paintings changed considerably when they were in a different environment.

The light, and also the density of the bush where I am, is similar to Algonquin Park. I'm just fifty miles further north. I have coloured slides of the Magnetawan River, taken in steaming August, that look like the Amazon. The bush and greenery come down and overhang the large river. It's a jungle! It's difficult to walk through that bush unless you stay close to the shore. I pretend Charlie's Place belongs to me even though I'm a squatter. I fix it up and believe it's mine every year. Charlie Clifton died about fifteen years ago. His wife, Myrtle, was magnificently jovial and rotund, a five foot tall, bleached blonde from Florida. She learned all the methods of skinning animals and filleting fish from the local trappers and Indians, and taught them to me. This teaching added to the tradition wood lore I had learned from my father, establishing a kind of continuity in my life.

I originally went to Charlie's as a boy to fish the river with my parents on their holidays. It wasn't until my late teens, when I started to go away with young ladies on weekends, that I realized it might be possible to rediscover this paradise. The first art I made there was in my first notebook, a few sketches from nature. I soon began to spend every summer there, back in the bush, enjoying the company of friends like Burton, Coughtry, Markle and sculptor Nobuo Kubota.

We found rusty implements, marvelous pieces of junk, where the loggers had passed through years before. We would make found-object sculptures, place them in the fields and deep in the bush, like silent, sacred totems, only to return the next year to find them crumpled, tilted and fallen. So we'd reconstruct them differently, giving them a new existence. Some are still there, rusting in the elements.

In my late twenties I began to pack in boxes of paint, bolts of canvas. I would go into the bush and seek out young poplars, to make an easel out of them, always using the local elements. Sometimes I'd utilize the wooden window shutters or the cedar shingle siding of the cabin, stretching the canvases over them. Consequently, I would get an indelible impression of what it was I was painting upon, soaking through the canvas. Up north I paint in the daytime, simply because at night I live by the light of coal oil lamps. I've tried working at night in the cabin and had some fun with it, with fifty candles burning at once; I nearly burned the place down. The colour, of course, is entirely different when you see it the next day. I concluded I couldn't do major works in the dark. So I began working in notebooks - collages, drawings, cartoons, ideas, prints, poems. Working in what we now refer to as Charlie's Books became a communal activity. Coughtry, Markle, Kubota and my friend John O'Keefe, the writer-sea captain, would visit and occasionally stay for a month at a time. Every evening, after a delicious dinner, the big square table would be cleared. There would follow the inevitable elbowing for room to draw, as everyone tried to grab more lamplight than the next guy. It was a delight; instead of playing cards or reading to pass the dark night, we'd be doing these books simultaneously. Occasionally we'd work in each other's books; the overlaps are pretty interesting. There was much playing of chess, drinking, talking, and laughter; but mostly we busied ourselves, entertaining each other with those marvelous books. And there was always music, thanks to a battery-operated record player -- I spent more money on batteries than on art supplies.

Unfortunately the Charlie's Books are too delicate to be exhibited; but as historical documents, with their cross references of (for example) four artists drawing each other at the same time, I'm convinced of their unique value. Within these pages are the sources of ideas that were later developed into major works. Hundreds of hilarious collages, outrageous puns and cartoons, loneliness expressed in the feminine curves of a glass lamp-chimney, recipes for pickerel bouillabaisse and wild rabbit stew, blood-covered pages decrying the kill, love letters to our ladies, indecipherable poems, cries, giggles, marks and angles; the beginnings of something.

It was about the time the Artists' Jazz Band was organized, eighteen years ago, that I first began to live at Charlie's during the summers. I took the AJB there a couple of times and I'll never forget the tiny rowboat struggling across the river, barely above the waterline, laden down with the complete band, including a saxophones, trombones, a contrabass, and a whole set of drums. During the night I would walk down to the river for a couple of buckets of water and I'd hear the wonderful improvised music emanating from the cabin on the hill, filling the wilderness with sounds that seemed to flow naturally with the wind and the river.

Luckily, this Magnetawan paradise is still available to me, and each spring I disappear into it, wanting to be swallowed up by its dense greenery and crashing rapids, to feel the look of it again. It has become a touchstone, a /tool/ by which, in my travels elsewhere, I am able to measure and evaluate. I know the Mediterranean light in comparison to the Magnetawan light. The impenetrable Pre-Cambrian rock underfoot allows me a deeper insight into the nature of the mountains of Guatemala and the Andes of Peru. I have a greater sense of the tropical vegetation of India and Nepal because of my familiarity with the birch bark and trillium of Ontario.

I love living in Toronto where the action is. And, needless to say, I love the north bush and traveling to other countries. But, thanks to the Canada Council, who helped me immeasurably throughout my formative years, it must be said that all my ventures and adventures abroad have consistently reminded me of the beauty and greatness of Canada, my home.

And so it goes. I intend to continue with this life, these investigative pleasures, discursive discussions with friends, to make music, to keep looking and to keep painting.

My friend Coughtry once said he continued to make art because there wasn't anything better to do. When you think about it, it's a profound statement. Painting is a remarkable unending adventure, full of risk and commitment. The joy is, there will always be new ways to bring home old truths, other ways to rediscover your eyes.

*Flowers and Leaves : constructing nature*

/"Cyborg women weave translucent thought into sturdy cloth and with Arachne still defy the gods." "Nature weaves a digital dream into the text and Philomela has her own web page now." "The Fates still weave with Ada's help on ancient looms and computers...."./ (artist's quotes for an earlier weaving)

Myths and stories about weavers have long been the focus of my work. Myths give shape to the past and inform our present and future. My involvement with mythic weavers, started with Penelope and Arachne, who were able to shape history through their weaving, as a powerful recorded language for women. My ideas about myths are about rationalizing the way symbols exhort power in a given society, so they flow fluidly from Greek myths to Fairy Tales, Science fiction and cyborgs.

My interest in Jacquard weaving started in 1997 when I read Ada Lovelace's quote: "The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves". Ada's unique background in art and science, poetry and mathematics (her father was a poet and her mother a mathematician), reflects my own interests in science, art and language. Ada translated a text by Manabrea about Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in 1843 and her notes, which took up more space than the original text, contained the above quote and the first instances of written software. The engine never quite worked, but contained the basic operating principles used by computers later. The process was derived from the Jacquard loom, which used punched cards to store and process complex information as zeros and ones. The Jacquard loom was developed in 1804 by Jacquard, in response to demands for weavings with elaborate imagery, influenced by fabrics brought back to Europe from Asia during the 18th century. Napoleon funded this new technology, to fill his empty war chest. The motifs feature mainly elaborate floral designs and thus provide an excellent forum for reinvesting patterning and imagery composed of flowers and leaves with new meanings. They also show unintended developments in technology.

Textiles have long played an important economic role and still do so today with NAFTA and global markets. Textiles reflect cultural exchanges, colonial relationships, cause trade wars and labour problems, (Ned Ludd was a Lancashire weaver, who fought the use of this new machinery and left us the term 'luddite'). Crafts and contemporary weaving are often associated with 'traditions' and a romantic view of a past, lost forever. Working with ones hands holds many of the same desires associated with a desire for untainted nature. In reality, textiles have been at the forefront of technological change. My hand-woven textiles combine the technologies of ancient looms with computers – art made possible through technology.

My relationship with 'Flowers and Leaves' evolved over time, influenced by backyard gardening and hikes in local mountains, as well as visits to museums to see historical textiles such as Bizzare and Rococo silks and chinoiseries. I am also interested in exploring issues of 'decoration' and its relationship to the 'feminine' reflected in textiles. Muybridge's photographic records from the 19th century show women doing domestic or mundane tasks. By layering these images with re-presentations of 'nature' I hope to demonstrate some of the contradictory assumptions about nature, culture, technology and gender roles.

Definitions of 'nature' reveal a range of contradictory meanings. Nature often suggests that which is separate from human activity and is used to project desires seemingly unattainable, thus "nature becomes romanticized, patronized and forever the passive recipient of our desires" (Kate Soper, /What is Nature? Culture, Politics and the non-Human)/. Donna Haraway in the Cyborg Manifesto proposes more fluid boundaries between humans, animals and machines instead of defining them in opposition. She suggests: "We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short we are Cyborg" and "The Cyborg myth subverts myriad organic wholes, in short, the certainty of what counts as nature - as a source of insight and promise of innocence - is undermined, probably fatally." /(Simian, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature)/. Computers and weaving have been connected in Sadie Plant's essay: /The Future Loom: Weaving Women and Cybernetics'/ and her book /'Zeros and Ones'/', which discuss weaving as digital processing of data. Weaving, of course, is, and always has been a digital process.

The images for my weavings were created in 'Photoshop' from various sources, including scans from real plants and books, digital photographs and images from websites. Then, the colours were reduced and translated into weave structures, using 'JacqCAD' or 'Pointcarr�' software (industrial Jacquard weaving softwares). The resulting file, containing only black and white information was then uploaded to a computerized Jacquard loom in Montreal at the Centre de Textile Contemporain de Montreal, where I wove initial tests and pieces by hand. Some pieces were also woven by a technician, from files I sent via the Internet.

My GPS patterns combine a scientific approach of collecting data and representing it as scientific evidence and I have been collecting all my GPS data now since July 2005. A track is defined as an event and I might have several tracks a say if I go for a walk, a drive and a bus ride. Some lines are combined and for others I separate them into different tracks for a drive + a walk at the end of it. This is where I can control that the viewer will not necessarily know everything I do or when I do it and I can shape the visual elements. Different modes of locomotion come with different scales, speeds, rhythms and shapes. On a recent trip in Italy I drove over a mountain pass with winding hairline turns only to arrive at a resort town hopelessly lost, driving around blocks and one-way streets to locate my hotel. Some tracks repeat very often, i.e. my drives to work or my runs in the neighbourhood, others are seasonal and some are caused by imposed changes, that might be pleasant or not.

I became aware of how I moved through space very early in this process and now often choose my ways carefully in view of this awareness of doing these mostly mundane tasks. But I never just go out to 'make tracks' (as others have done). I have uploaded one of my more interesting run to a website, where runners share their favourite runs from all over the world, and was surprised that they were mostly not very interesting visually.

Coming from scientific research where I studied cell normal and abnormal development and spent many hours looking at cells to see when a variant was abnormal. Later as a weaver and artist working in textiles, the language of pattern became a main interest, how do fabrics such as pins stripes suits, jeans and kitchen towels communicate as patterns (rather than objects) Mostly then my interest was in disrupting those patterns or making our automatic reading of them evident. Also in my hand weaving I focused on patterns that were interesting (again on the microscopic level) i.e. patterns with as many colours as possible and patterns that evolved dynamically to create narratives.

Influenced by Richard Long's evocative walks in exotic or places, removed from the daily bustle of life, I want to instead make sense of those very mundane trips. The things we do daily, rather than those we dream about. Reading Rebecca Solnit's /Wanderlust: A History of Walking/ shows that walking can have many different purposes from pilgrims and spiritual journeys to hikers, celebrating nature and healthy living and pushing their physical strength. I am also interested in the idea of exploring the city, or what Walter Benjamin calls 'to go botanizing on the asphalt" and more absurdist structural approaches explored by 'Situationists' and 'Psychogeography', where we suspend habits and preconceptions and set up systems to discover patterns we have not seen before.

In terms of formats or medium I am currently working in parallel between digital prints, interactive websites, stitched and woven images and some 3d experiments. Each medium allows for different visual interpretation or information to be included, has different technical requirements and presents different historical or cultural contexts.

More than half the landmass of Canada is Treaty Land; Including the including the land which has been ceded or reserved under the terms of the eleven numbered treaties signed between the Government of Canada and many of the First Nations in central Canada. Also covered under numerous earlier, smaller treaties are areas of southern Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and the Eastern Provinces. Vast areas of Northern Quebec, the North West Territories, British Columbia and all of Newfoundland have never been brought under treaty.

In reviewing the written terms of the numbered treaties it is shocking to note the vast tracts of landed ceded by, and the pittance reserved for, Native tribes. It is telling to examine how the terms of the treaties changed between the signing of Treaties 1 and 2 in Manitoba in 1871 and the last of the numbered treaty adhesions signed in 1954 and 1956. Slowly, the Government began paying just a little more attention to the positions of Native negotiators. Even more telling are the terms of the Agreement in Principle signed by the Nisga'a of British Columbia and the Federal Government in 1996. The Nisga'a demanded, fought long and hard for and finally won, a fair deal.

All of Manitoba is covered under five separate agreements; Treaties 1 and 2, Treaty 3, Treaty 4 and Treaty 5 signed between 1871 and 1956. The entire northern half of Manitoba as well as parts of Saskatchewan and the North West Territories were ceded through a key adhesion to Treaty 5 in 1908. Currently, a number of ongoing First Nations claims regarding Government failure to honor treaty commitments remain in contention.

It is within the bounds of these Treaty Lands that I have lived, worked and travelled over the last eighteen years. It is these landscapes and the histories they carry which I have explored in my art over that time. The power of the Aboriginal presence in this province is great. And the level of racism and intolerance amongst non-Aboriginal peoples here is also great. It is my hope that people who see my Treaty Lands work will enjoy it for what it is, but at the same time will give some of these ideas at the very least, passing thought. And that from time to time when we step out our front doors, we will consider the notion that this is Treaty Land and what that might mean as we move through our day.

I left Montreal at the age of seventeen to study painting at the Pratt Institute in New York City. From that year (1966) until 1972, I attended fine art schools in Boston, Maine and Montreal, and finally the New York Studio School of Drawing and Painting. Alex Katz, Philip Guston, and Sidney Tillim, all figurative painters, were among those who made the strongest impression on me during my final student years.

I stayed on in New York for the next eight years, painting and doing odd jobs, including work as an assistant film editor. Although never interested in making my own movies, my painting was informed by the narrative structure of film.

As a student in 1970’s New York I learned to paint in what was even then considered the "tradition" of abstraction. However, I found my own voice as an artist when I rejected the tenets of abstraction in my own practice and embarked on my lifelong fascination with the challenging tradition of narrative figure painting. It was an invitation to teach painting in Vancouver, British Columbia which brought me back to Canada in 1980. I have since taught in various schools throughout North America and currently teach at Concordia University in Montreal.

In my studio practice I work with a specific narrative as my theme for a period of one to three years, using texts as diverse as the novels of Kafka, Yiddish folk tales and most recently, Cocteau’s Les Enfants Terribles. Scenes evlove from the dramatic interplay between characters who appear from painting to painting. I often base these characters on my family and friends, intertwining the complexities of their individual developments into that of the story.

I incorporate direct observation as well as photographs of scenes which I stage using live models and costumes. The process of working back and forth from model to photograph to canvas can continue for many months, creating a layering of reality and narrative interpretation. My technique is loosely based on the pre-impressionist oil painting process of laying glazes over a well delineated underpainting. Beyond the dramatic effects of light and dark which underpainting and glazing allow, this technique gives me a deep sense of continuity fundamental to my narrative expression.

/Transition/ My current work continues an investigation into the formal relationship between painting and photography, focusing on the architecture and landscape of freeways and the buffer of land between the city and the countryside. The transition, dislocation and isolation that I experience driving through this sprawling landscape are used in the work as a metaphor for broader feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.

These highways follow routes from one point to another, with converging and diverging overpasses and roads; they are spaces of passage. The architecture and landscape of these urban outskirts, with their airports and hotels, acts as a transitional zone passed through enroute to unknown destinations. These paintings often employ a single point perspective: the vantage point of the passenger during the journey. The viewer is the sole passenger in these empty vistas. Often one or two planes in the distance intersect the view. Some of the paintings depict the architecture of the side views off these transitional routes; frozen glimpses of anonymous industrial parks, interstitial fields, hydro towers and subdivisions. It is this unattainable frozen viewpoint, from which I experience these passing vistas via the photographic process that creates the sense of displacement.

I am interested in exploring painting as a reductive process, wiping away parts of the original photographic image. The images begin as photographs transferred to mylar. I can then isolate and combine architectural and pictorial elements from different photographs on to one image. Familiar elements are then wiped away, replaced with a painted void. The final painting on mylar combines both photographic and painted image. One intrinsic quality of the photograph is that it stands as a record of a time and place. I am excited by the potential of how far this property can be erased before meaning collapses. Thus, my current body of work is larger in scale, moving away from the single point perspective into a less clearly defined pictorial space.

*Of All Forms of Photography, The most Luminous, Enduring and Rare. Why They Look so Beautiful. How They are Made.*

Platinum prints are not only the most permanent and stable of any medium on paper, they are perhaps the most exquisite as well. Nothing else looks like a platinum image. No other photographic process can achieve the ethereal luminosity and three dimensional appearance of the platinum photograph. Platinum is one of the most inert elements know to man, even more stable than gold. A platinum print is in fact as permanent as the paper it is printed on.

During photography’s "golden age", at the turn of the century and into the 1900’s, the platinum print was a dominant medium. If you were a serious photographer, you did your work on platinum paper. But suddenly it was unavailable because of the World War: platinum was strategic, and Russia had most of the world’s supply.

After the war, platinum was again available-but it was now more expensive than gold. And prepared papers were no longer manufactured. So everything had to be done by hand using the finest materials, with infinite patience and consummate skill. Platinum prints became the special, "private reserve" of the masters.

Today, less than % of fine art photographs are printed in platinum-because it is ten times more costly to the artist, and significantly harder to do.

*How platinum prints are created*

  	1. Platinum prints have to be made from full-sized, perfect photographic negatives, contact printed on specially prepared hand-coated paper. Unlike ordinary silver photography, in which the print is customarily "dodged" and "burned", in platinum printing no manipulation of the image is possible after the negative is made. If the artist fails "to get it right the first time", he will waste tens of hours of labor, and hundreds of dollars in materials, since any faults are ruthlessly revealed.

2. The photographer must prepare the platinum printing paper. He selests among two or three of the finest papers in the world. The choice is an important decision. The beautiful subliminal qualities of the paper will become intrinsic with the image. Any invisible impurities cause unpredictable results. The paper must be absolutely pure, consistent in quality-and perhaps, considering the expense of the platinum salts, no too thirsty!

3. The photographer must also become something of an organic chemist. Complex solutions are carefully mixed from scratch, and measured out in tiny amounts, to make the light-sensitive emulsion that will coat the paper. Solid platinum is dissolved with potassium and chlorine in a series of acid baths; the acid is replaced with water, and the solution is crystallized into a platinum salt. This is combined with light-sensitive iron salts (ferric oxalte). Modern platinum printers usually intermingle platinum with palladium of iridium salts, to produce subtle variations in "warmth" (soft brown color) and contrast. The photographer must rely upon experience and instinct-and good luck-to achieve the desired effects.

4. Dissolved in pure water the platinum and iron salts are the emulsion, which is hand-coated with a brush onto a sheet of paper. The paper is then dried. It is usually used immediately, so only a few pieces of prepared paper are made at a time. Throughout the process, the photographer is well advised to keep a detailed, exact record of every step-the paper used, the number of drops of the chemicals, the proportions of the mixtures, the humidity of the environment and the paper, etc.-so that errors are not repeated. Errors are frighteningly expensive and time-consuming! Even when all goes well, it is not uncommon for a platinum photographer to make between five and fifteen attempts, with various combinations, to achieve the first "perfect print" from a new negative.

5. The negative is placed in direct contact with the paper, held down under a sheet of heavy glass. Platinum is so stable, that even in a photosensitive salt, it is reluctant to change. To expose a platinum print requires hundreds of times more energy than a silver print. The exposure time may vary from minutes to a full hour, depending upon many variables, due to the density of the negative.

6. The ultraviolet light "reduces" (purifies) the platinum salt to a darker, pure metallic state. A faint outline of the image appears on the paper when exposure is nearly complete. The fully exposed paper is then taken into the laboratory, and a special chemical bath is poured upon it. Development is instantaneous. Then, a series of mild acid baths remove any remaining traces of iron and other extraneous material from the paper. The final image is formed out of submicroscopic crystals of pure platinum metals, embedded in the Since pure platinum, like gold, is so stable and permanent, the platinum print is the most archival of any image made on paper. Silver prints will change visibly in a few years or a lifetime. The platinum print can last for centuries and centuries, as long as the fine paper-and the image will never change.


Beyond their permanence, platinum prints also have a unique appearance. They are amazingly luminous, and even appear to be three-dimensional. This results from the enormous tonal scale composing the platinum image. A silver photograph can never have more than ten or twelve separated grey tones: the values of the negative are compressed and amputated when printed on silver paper. With up to 500% more scale, the platinum print has by far the most expanded tonal range of any image, in any medium, in the world.

/Uniquely beautiful and enduring-and so ruthlessly difficult; platinum prints are reserved for the finest images, of the most skilled photographers, who make them in small amounts for a special reason. This have been true from the birth of photography to the present day./

The photograph "Mary is Here" is an image of my mother taken in 1944. She is standing in the middle of a group of men – the "final checking crew" at Central Aircraft in London, Ontario. The occasion, as noted on the back of the photograph in my mother’s hand, is the production of the 1000th Bolingbroke bomber. I was six years old at time and would have just learned to print with a pencil.

There seems a certain poignancy to me in the obviousness of my printed observation. Perhaps the awkwardness of the hand is a reminder of the feat of abstraction this simple phrase represents. Perhaps, too, I am remembering the pride she felt at the time to have achieved this level of responsibility – she who was always embarrassed not to have finished more than 10 years of formal school training.

Some 30 years later, while learning to paint, I came back to this photograph. You may have noticed the lettered grid around the edges revealing the primitive system I used to enlarge the image. I no longer have that painting or even the figure of Mary, which I cut out because it was the only part of the painting I wanted to preserve. I remember keeping that canvas figure rolled up in my studio for years. But I have moved on twice since then and it seems nowhere to be found.

Before 30 years passed again I returned to this photograph once more. This time after her death. It has become something else now, it is evidence. Along with all the other photographs, the voice tapes, the personal artifacts, even the handwriting, it is evidence of a life lived by a particular person who happened to be my mother. It is as difficult now to affirm my own personal reality as it was when I had only a thick pencil with which to work.

My mother always considered herself to be an atypical woman of her generation. Having assembled all the evidence, I’m not so sure any more. This Mary seems to melt into so many other Mary’s, so many other mothers, so many other women. Perhaps that observation is linked to this stage of my own life, when it has become the clearest that I am also my mother. Arlene Stamp Visit the web site component to this exhibition

The work of J.W.Stewart combines photographic and documentary material (photos, reproductions, maps, typeset texts, technical illustrations, graphs and charts, etc.) in a painterly context with effects of transparency and translucency and often feature attached assemblages and dimensional or sculptural supports.

This work is visually analogous to 'sampling' techniques now used in recording music where existing parts and pieces of music recordings or other recordings are taken, altered and combined with original material to form a new whole. In many ways, Stewart's work functions as a kind of visual sampling. Features of Stewart's work recall aspects of a number of issues currently of critical interest. The use of text has been a prominent and constant feature of this work. Issues of appropriation are raised in the use of photographic and documentary resources.

The images used are often treated and manipulated using computers, color-photocopiers and other photo-mechanical techniques. They are edited, altered, distorted and have their colors shifted before being combined with drawn elements, paint and other media in the finished pieces.

Textual material is used in a variety of ways in Stewart's work. Some texts are composed and set in type by the artist. Others are combined from disparate existing sources and then set into type. Most often the appropriated texts are edited or rearranged; their meaning shifted to suit their new setting both in terms of meaning and of their formal qualities. Texts are sometimes taken directly from printed sources (reproduced in the source's typesetting) as are the charts, graphs, technical and scientific diagrams and drawings that also appear in these works. Entire pages are sometimes lifted wholesale and used unaltered.

Some texts can be scanned normally and read through from beginning to end. Others function as free verse, automatic poetry or fragmented speech. The inclusion mediates between the standard reading of a painting and one where the overall painterly context is in tension with material of a different nature. The use of text as a formal element rather than for the meaning of the words juxtaposed with texts that are pointedly intended to be read and to carry meaning along with the photographic, diagramatic and schematic referents requires another way of 'reading' visual information.

The technical diagrams and schematic illustrations when taken apart from their sources, 'edited' and stripped of their original meaning can be seen as pure drawing or may seem to take on obscure, mysterious, or gnostic qualities. There is an awareness at work of the mutability of signs. The ambiguity of the references' symbolic value is exploited by their rearrangement within the work. In these works, rather than being decried or protested, the ambivalence and distortion of signs and symbols are accepted as given, noted in passing, and used to further the work's proposition or theme.

Whereas Stewart's first loyalty is with the internal economies of the pieces as independent parts of an ongoing body of work. Stewart is more particularly concerned with the 'mapping' of meanings. While the instrumentality of the displacement of image and meaning is evident, it is taken to be symptomatic rather than causal in a social context. Images or fragments may reappear in several paintings, but with different treatments, scale and atmosphere, they serve a variety of ends. So that a given piece may employ elements with differing natures or mechanisms of effect to create a new mapping of meaning or signification. It is this variety, and especially these ends which are examined.

Les œuvres de J.W. Stewart combinent dans un environnement pictural à facture variable des matériaux photographiques et documentaires (photographies, reproductions, cartes, textes typographiques, illustrations techniques, graphiques, etc.) avec des effets de transparence et de translucidité. Il incorpore souvent des assemblages et des supports tridimensionnels ou sculpturaux.

Son œuvre est une analogie visuelle des techniques d'échantillonnage utilisées en musique, oà des pièces et des extraits d'enregistrements musicaux ou autres sont sélectionnés, modifiés et combinés avec du matériel original pour créer un ensemble inédit. Sous plusieurs aspects, le travail de Stewart se conçoit comme un échantillonnage visuel. Nombre de caractéristiques de ce travail soulèvent des questions d'un intérêt critique très actuel. Son usage du texte en est une constante marquante. L'usage de sources photographiques et documentaires soulève également des questions liées à l'appropriation.

Les images que l'artiste utilise sont souvent traitées et transformées par l'usage d'ordinateurs, de photocopieurs couleur et d'autres techniques photo-mécaniques. Elles sont éditées, altérées, déformées ou décolorées avant d'être combinées dans les œuvres avec des éléments de dessin, de peinture et d'autres techniques.

Dans son travail, Stewart utilise le matériel textuel de façons variées. Il compose lui-même et met en forme certains des textes. D'autres émanent de combinaisons de diverses sources existantes et sont ensuite mis en forme. Le plus souvent, les textes qu'il s'approprie sont édités ou redisposés ; leur sens propre et leur signification graphique sont transformés pour correspondre à leur nouveau contexte. Certains textes sont parfois tirés directement de sources imprimées (ou reproduits avec la police source), comme le sont les graphiques et les diagrammes scientifiques ou techniques qui figurent également dans ces œuvres. Des pages entières peuvent parfois être extraites et utilisées sans altération.

Certains textes peuvent être parcourus normalement et lus du début à la fin. D'autres s'apparentent au vers libre, à la poésie automatiste ou au discours fragmenté. Cette inclusion sert de relais entre la lecture normale de la peinture et une lecture où le contexte de peinture et en tension avec un matériau issu d'autres techniques. La juxtaposition du texte comme simple élément formel plutôt que pour le sens des mots, et d'autres textes qui sont de toute évidence destinés à la lecture et qui véhiculent un sens en sus de leur référents photographiques, diagrammatiques et schématiques, impose une manière différente de " lire " l'information visuelle.

Les diagrammes techniques et illustrations schématiques détachés de leurs sources, " édités " et dépouillés de leur sens original peut être apparenté à du dessin pur ou peut prendre des qualités obscures, mystérieuses ou même gnostiques. Il règne ainsi une conscience de la mutabilité des signes. L'ambiguïté des valeurs symboliques des référents est exploitée par leur réarrangement dans le cadre de l'œuvre. Dans ces œuvres, l'ambivalence et la distorsion des signes est donnée plutôt que critiquée, elle se remarque au passage et est utilisée pour construire la proposition ou le thème de l'œuvre.

Bien que l'attachement premier de Stewart soit à l'économie interne des œuvres en tant que parties indépendantes de son travail, il se préoccupe particulièrement de la question de la cartographie des significations. Si l'instrumentalité des glissements d'images et de sens est évidente, elle doit être vue comme un symptôme plutôt qu'une cause du contexte social. Certains images et fragments peuvent réapparaître dans plusieurs tableaux mais avec un traitement ou une atmosphère différente ou à une autre échelle, et ainsi être employés à des fins très variées. Et une œuvre peut utiliser des éléments de natures diverses, des techniques ou des effets pour créer une nouvelle cartographie de significations. C'est cette variété et ces fins tout particulièrement qui sont examinées.

Ernestine Tahedl was born and educated in Austria and received a Master's Degree in graphite art from the Vienna Academy of Applied Arts. Following graduation in 1961, she collaborated with her father, Professor Heinrich Tahedl, in the design and execution of stained glass commissions until she immigrated to Canada in 1963. Her studio is in King City, Ontario. Her work is represented in public, corporate and private collections and galleries in Canada, the United States, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan. Her awards include the Graduation Prize of the Austrian Government, 1961; the Bronze Medal of the Vienna International Exhibition of Paintings, 1963; The Allied Arts Medal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada; 1966; and a purchase award, Concourse Artistique du Quebec, 1966. In 1967, she received a Canada Council Arts Award. She was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1977 and the Ontario Society of Artists in 1984 and is a member of the Executive of the Arts foundation of Greater Toronto. She received the Governor General's Canada 125th Anniversary Medal in 1993.

In my painting I seek to continue an itinerary from a European formation, from a semiotic view point to a poetic abstraction. When describing my process of painting I like to bring forth, to draw an analogy by pointing onto the space found between the words of a typeset page, of a text.

I paint 'with ( ) out ( ) words' and embrace the notion of space between 'printed words', as it Is that space which allow for more to happen. The intent focuses on that felt space where motions take note from a place beyond description.

A painting results from time spent 'drawing down', observing pure states of beauty in colour in which new visions occur. Multiple facets or possibilities call for hinging points to draw a bridge -- Silence -- to a continuum. Inner spaces paint and catalyze the language of colour and simple forms. The image draws itself, when background and balances within

My work centres on the body in large prints and drawings made on supports of paper, slate and cloth. The body fragments often stands alone as a signifier or is used in conjunction with fully represented bodies. I use the fragment to regain a sense of potency for the body image; to disassociate from a viewing of its as figure; to relate to it as subject. I am also interested in the ability of the fragment to both stand in for the whole and to trigger association in the viewer with meanings suggested by the symbolism of specific parts. The body parts function as glyphs (to be viewed either singly or in relation to each other) which are decoded in part through a sort of bodily understanding or cellular memory.

The body parts are used in conjunction with referenced to cultural artifacts, contemporary and ancient. In the resulting composite images/objects various time periods and locations coexist simultaneously. Tablets, textiles, scrolls, sculptures, paintings, maps, manuals and medical illustrations are alluded to; some from long extinct civilizations. The human desire to leave a mark, to alter the terrain, to create and understand is mapped onto the body in the form of excerpted images and texts, tables, diagrams and designs. The body presents a site for the writing of these histories and for the examination of diverse systems of knowledge, organization and understanding.

The part object is a constant throughout the work, even when the body is not directly represented. For example in Vanitas (1995) representations of garments and portions of garments taken from art historical sources point to the absent body as subject. Issues of survival, ephemerality and vulnerability are dealt with in the context of these fragments. The body is seen in my work as a region of the imagination, a territory of uncetainty.

My works examine the body in relation to history, cultural production, nature, and identity through the nexus of the fragment. Redrawn and altered material quoted from diverse historical sources is incorporated into my printed images/objects to form new composites in an exploration of both the ephemerality of the body and our desire to leave a mark: to create, organize, and understand. The work posits the body as artifact and archive, and as a region of the imagination-a territory of uncertainty.

I began making woodblock prints in 1977. In 1988/89, I began introducing woodcuts into my photo-based work. In 1992 I was one of 8 Canadian artists represented in "X Mostra da Gravura Cidade de Curitiba\Mostra Americana", at the Museu da Gravura, Curitiba, Brazil, a curated international print exhibition focusing on alternate forms of printmaking. I exhibited several multi-paneled works that combined woodcuts, photography, and light-boxes; the prints in these works expressed various ways in which the black and white woodblock could reflect photographic elements. One large work, "Machine-Gun", is in the collection of the Winnipeg Art Gallery. Over a ten year period in the 90's and early 2000's, I made and exhibited many works like this. Some of them used computers and computer-based elements. One of these was "Autobiography", the first work at the Winnipeg Art Gallery to use the web and Internet. All my work in these forms represented the fundamental premise of my work, which was the way in which different visual forms can be reflected in one another and merged into coherent works.

My earliest works with computers pre-dated most of the the graphical features that we take for granted today, so that I had to develop my own software, as in "Autobiography", which is where I first became interested how digital images are formed, i.e. with pixels, and that if the image is enlarged enough we are left with pixelization. Pixelization mirrors so nicely the modern sense that if we look closely enough at physical reality, it disappears. In 1994/1995 I made several prints in which I tried to find a graphic language for representing "pixelized" images. In 1998 I made a series of woodblocks based on digitized images from Edweard Muybridge, which grew out of my web site "Animal Locomotion", for which Muybridge was the starting point. I continued to explore ways of representing the zoomed digitized image. These woodcuts have twice won awards at the Boston Printmakers' North American Print Biennial. I exhibited them at the International Print Center New York, at the 2003 Print Biennial of The Print Club, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.

I worked in various ways. In some prints, for instance, I use the idea of the photo inset where a small section of an image is magnified and overlaid onto the original; in these prints the inset is magnified into a pixelized section. I used found photos and the works of my favorite photgraphers, printmakers, and painters. In my last prints I made a series of prairie landscapes, small prints, almost sketch-like. For physical reasons, after this series, I could not make prints and gave my attention instead to projects for the Internet, where I have been working since the early 90's.

Tony Urquhart was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on the 9th of April 1934. He was recognized in the late 50s and early 60s as one of Canada's pioneering abstractionists, having been variously linked with the Toronto painters associated with The Isaacs Gallery and The Heart of London group that included Jack Chambers, Greg Curnoe and Murray Favro. He was also, with Chambers and Kim Ondaatje, one of the founders of CAR/FAC (Canadian Artists Representation/Frontes des Artistes Canadiens), the artists' 'union' that first established a fee schedule for public museum and gallery exhibitions of contemporary artists. Since the 60s Urquhart has followed an independent and autonomous path centred upon his distinctive 'box' format.

Between 1954 and 1958 Tony Urquhart was trained at the Albright Art School, a division of the fine art department of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and at Yale University. In 1960 he became the University of Western Ontario's first artist-in-residence, after which he taught in the art department, before moving on to the University of Waterloo. He became full professor of Fine Art there in 1972, teaching drawing and painting as well as serving periodically as the head of the department. His studio and home are in nearby Wellesley where he lives with his poet/novelist wife, Jane.

Urquhart's association with Av Isaacs goes back to 1956, when he was only 22. Isaacs asked Urquhart to join his growing stable of artists, including Michael Snow, Joyce Weiland and Graham Coughtry. Two years later he embarked on the first of what would become annual, if not more frequent, sojourns to Europe, attracted to what he called the 'otherness' of the visual experiences there, especially the landscape, architecture and pilgrimage sites such as Lourdes and Vimy Ridge in France.

As curator of the McIntosh Gallery at Waterloo, Urquhart was responsible for the initial showings of Greg Curnoe, Walter Redinger, Ed Zelenak and John B. Boyle.

Tony Urquhart's first major retrospective was mounted by the London Regional Art Gallery in 1970, subsequent to which he began to serve widely on juries and, along with Chambers, was consulted concerning the establishment of the Canada Council's Art Bank collection. Other retrospective exhibitions were presented at the At Gallery of Kitchener (1978) and the Art Gallery of Windsor (1988), both of which toured extensively from Newfoundland to British Columbia.

Tony Urquhart's book illustration has put him in collaboration with such authors as his wife Jane, Michael Ondaatje, Matt Cohen and Louis Dudek. His work is prominent in the collections of such institutions as New York's Museum of Modern Art; the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England; the Hirshorn Collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.; the Bibliotec National in Paris; the Museo Civico in Lugano; and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.

Tony Urquhart was named to the Order of Canada in 1995.                                            /[with thanks to Joan Vastokas]/

When I was a child, there were creative people in my family: a great aunt who painted pottery; my mother who did little watercolours under instruction at school and my father who was a photographer at one time, and serious about his work. But I never had a relative who was an artist /per se/. Actually, my grandmother was quite a strong influence throughout my life. She was an artist in the sense that she liked landscaping the grounds of our house, which were considerable, given the fact that we lived in the centre of the town of Niagara Falls on half an acre. She had ponds made; there was a wood; there was an old barn in the back of the house. It was like an oasis of quiet

This probably had an influence on making me into a landscape artist, which is basically what I would define myself as. I have done very little figurative work; I've never really been interested in the human figure. One reason is that I didn't go to the Ontario College of Art. Drawing the figure was the subject most taught at the College and everyone who went there came to rely heavily on the human figure. Unlike most of my contemporaries, through sheer chance, (because it was easier to commute to Buffalo from Niagara Falls than to Toronto) I got my training at the Albright Art School (a division of The Fine Art Department of the University of Buffalo), which I attended from 1954 to 1958. My teachers were Seymore Drumlevitch, still an important painter in Western New York, Larry Calcagno, who was with the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, and Don Nicholls, a very good advertising design teacher who is still there, and also Robert Bruce, a Canadian who taught illustration. Bruce was very interested in control of depth and in weaving space through a painting. Sensitivity to things like that I think are vitally important for a landscape painter, even though they may not be directly used.

I had my first show at the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto when I was in third year art school. My influence was from Buffalo, directly from the Abstract Expressionists and in 1956 this influence was new in Toronto and the Toronto public thought my aesthetic - abstract expressionism - was really interesting. In January of 1958 I graduated from art school but I had already had my second one-man show at the Isaacs Gallery. I got married in July 1959, and went over to Europe in September, staying away for a whole year. I saw, in particular, works by Goya in The Prado, Madrid.

I lived in Niagara Falls until the end of 1960 when I went to London to be Artist-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario. I was the second Artist-in-residence in Canada, Goodridge Roberts having preceded me at the University of New Brunswick.

I am most often described as being a landscape painter, and I suppose I am, but I am not of the 'scenic' variety. I don't seek out and record the novel or search for impressive natural splendour to depict. I consider that a form of 'artistic tourism', getting a small taste of an alien locale, recording quick sketches of a place you have no real connection to, and then elaborating the theme from faint and passing impressions. The result, more often than not, is that you create mole-hills out of mountains.

I prefer to paint subjects on a more modest and familiar scale, weeds, rocks, trees which are found in my own backyard, 400 acres worth. When I paint small themes on a large scale, I gain rather than lose a sense of monumentality.

I wouldn't call what I do 'realistic' but something more like 'believable'. An intimate engagement with what I paint is essential. Even in non-landscape pieces like the still life in my show, I required intimacy with my subject. The art and books depicted are from my own collection. If I didn't actually own these pieces, but just copied them from an art book, it would have been an empty exercise. The collecting of the objects was part of the art-making process, many years in the making.

I like the traditional format of doing watercolour sketches first, then doing an elaborated version later. This allows me to explore memory and imagination fully as it relates to the place, allows me to elaborate, simplify and anamorphisize as needed. The distortions caused by misperceptions are just as important as the raw data that one could collect by photography. Strangely enough, the finished painting feels more real than the on the spot product.

Impressionism has its limitations. The concern about accurate depiction is there, but it must give way to the needs of good 'picture making' and good 'paint pushing'. I want to find a middle ground between realism and abstraction, using no more of either than necessary.

I avoid details showing a 'moment in time', like a bird in flight, because it trivializes the subject by placing a limit on the experience. For that reason I either play down or even banish cast shadows.

If it took hours to do the sketch and months for it to sit around until used, then weeks to finish the piece, I would like the work to reflect, in some way, the passing of time, maybe implying that the plants depicted are still in the act of growing: The scene being an average representation rather than a snapshot frozen in time.

/Painting is What I do, Nature is What I Like/ An Intimate Approach to Landscape

I was born in 1957 and raised in North York, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, where I began painting at the age of 13. My allied activities at this time were geology, chemistry and natural science. My interest in nature was more toward the experience, rather than understanding it. Exploring and experiencing the city ravines directly influenced me to become an artist. As this landscape did not include panoramic views, such as landscapes or forest interiors, weeds and rocks, this approach has remained with me throughout the years and only recently have I begun to paint skies, a much broader subject.

I find the further away from me a subject is, the less connection and interest I have in it. My satisfaction remains in making 'a mountain out of a molehill'. To me, the smaller a subject is the more monumental it seems. I seldom leave my 160 hectare farm in Bruce county to sketch. It's all here - I'm an extreme regionalist.

I don't use photographs as part of the painting process. I feel it is critical to get the details right and record both one's perceptions and misperceptions. The on-site experience allows me to choose which elements to emphasize, where to abstract, and, where to simplify or detail.

When I paint a large oil version of a smaller field sketch, the work goes through another level of transformation. Often, the finished work seems more real or believable than the former.

Site is very important - broad 'scenic' landscape is akin to tourist post cards or snapshots. When I sketch an unfamiliar site, I feel that I fail to catch its essence. I prefer a site that I can revisit often and get to know intimately. This enables me to go beyond impressionism to a more holistic approach.

Sometimes it takes me only hours to do a watercolour sketch but then it sits around for months. When I do the finished work, it may again take a few weeks. This enables me to depict the scene in the fullness of time, as if the herbs and trees are growing and dying before my eyes. One way of achieving this effect is by banishing objects that take me to an exact moment in time, e.g.. a bird in flight or a falling leaf. I also de-emphasize shadows for this same reason.

Unlike most nature artists, I'm quite ignorant about the names of plants. It's something I don't need to know. To prevent myself from painting in a finicky style, I always paint the smallest possible detail with my largest possible brush. I'm happy that this business of painting allows me to shamelessly exploit nature, without having to destroy it. I'm left with the option, if not duty, to improve on it.

The major artistic influences on my career have been: Emily Carr, Vincent Van Gogh, The Group of Seven, and several Chinese painters of the Sung Dynasty. When not painting, I'm an avid TV watcher, mostly cartoons, and reader of art, history and religion. As well, I write poetry and play the stock market.

*"The Mildest of Fish"*

I am The Mildest of Fish

Golden to the touch. I am well formed, And practically take care of myself.

See me, Shining, in the sunlight And skulking about the property Doing what I do...

I am the smallest of things, Kosher to the touch. The most heroic of rodent, The wildest of horsetail, 	Most mortal of gods.

Wake me, when I'm older... Kiss me, and I'll cry! I am the most fleeting of thoughts, The most singular of mollusk, Most certainly the least of my kind. I am the creature I always knew I could be.

Touch me, And I'll - die.

A DESCRIPTION AND REFLECTION UPON TWO RECENT WORKS/

The theme of the studio has appeared constantly in my work since 1969 when I began documenting my workspace in a way that related the intellectual aspects of conceptual art with direct references to the material production of the art object, a self-consciously modernist strategy which still informs my work. As the space of production — the specific location of the construction of artwork in both the material and intellectual sense, as the place where the idea is produced as an object for con-templation and distribution — the image of the studio functions as a pictorial grounding of the concep-tual aspects of my work. From the beginning, this ‘objectivication of thought was established also as an intellectual montage’, a link between literary material and a physical, technical process associated with objectness. The image of a random assembly of books and writing materials on a table occurs throughout the subsequent development of my work: this can be seen in /Summer Script/ (1973) , /Image / text/ (I979), /Art Work/ (1983), /In the Studio/ (1984), /Studio / Museum / Street/ (1986), /The Idea of the University/ (1990), and in most of the works of my ‘Hotel series’ in which hotel rooms became a workspace while travelling. The theme of the studio also acts as a personal chronicle and self-reflection on the work itself in relation to the objective social space of the other two recurring the-matic locations that appear in my work: the museum and the street.

But in the more recent work, particularly /Corner of the Studio/ and /El Taller/, references to questions of production has signalled a shift in my work from an emphasis on questions of subject matter and signification to the aesthetic, ideological, and technical relations between painting and ph-tography. /Corner of the Studio/ and /El Taller/ were made especially for Galeria Tomas March of Valencia in 1993 and are related to each other in a specific way. Both works are of identical dimensions and formats. Both works consist of an arrangement of four canvases that combine photo-graphs of my studio with rectangular sections of inked impressions of plywood on acrylic.

The first work, /Corner of the Studio/, was completed in march 1993. Although in fact in the spring of 1987, at the time that I photographed it, I was producing several large canvases (for instance, /My Heroes in the Streets/), none of this work is visible in the image. Therefore, what is represented in this earlier work is more a space for thinking than production itself. In contrast, the second series, /El Taller/, was photographed in the same studio space (to the right of the windows visible in /Corner of the Studio/) and is in effect a reprise, a ‘correction’ of the intellectual ambience of the first work by emphasizing the physical fabrication of the work itself, and thus the studio as a working space’ (in spanish, ‘/El Taller/’).

Furthermore, in the earlier work titled /Corner of the Studio/, the image represents the studio as a place for intellectual production only in an indirect way. Unlike other works of this type (eg. the ‘/Hotel/ series’), there is not even any paperwork in evidence, only boxed musical and recording equipment, and a single open book on the divan. Yet the various objects and furniture in the image do indicate potential activity: the forementioned book, musical equipment, an ashtray and a case of beer. Industrial buildings can be seen through the window. The open book, on the edge of the divan next to the chair (largely obscured) where I had been sitting, is in fact, although indecipherable as such in the photograph, ‘/Un Coup de Dés/’ by Stephane Mallarmé, a book which, over the past twenty years, has functioned for me as a cipher for abstraction as a poetic concept, for the concept of the ‘unreadable’ at those moments when there seems to be ‘nothing to say’.

The actual taking of the photograph involved an interruption in the act of reading this book. As for the interruption itself, I do remember that it was the unexpected arrival of Paul Arbez, a friend who documents most of my wok on large-format transparencies. The production of this image then was an ‘enfolding’ of this interruption into my passive act of reading and daydreaming so that my absent-mindedness was intersected with another kind of purposive activity: the positioning of the camera, taking light readings, and so on. The technical operation of photography thus functioned as a self-conscious witness to my private act of reading, as well as providing a concrete spatial reference for an abstract conceptual activity, a document of a specific, narrative autobiographical moment, an objec-tive preservation of an abstract instance of time. The photograph was then put into the archives until resurrected five years later.

This photographic element of /Corner of the Studio/ is in fact a single image cut into four parts. The photograph was first cut in half, after which a rectangular section was then cut from each half, thus providing four segments that were then laminated onto separate canvases, all of which were arranged to approximate the coherence of the original photograph. The specificity of each segment, which is identified by its photographic information, is also determined by the dynamic spatial contrasts, textures and colours of the ‘abstract’ sections of the canvas area which replace the areas of the ‘cut-away’ section of each part of the original photograph, and thus this excision of photographic space has provided a catalyst for a latent painterly practice.

These ‘abstract’ sections are the dynamic, ‘hot’, shifting part of the canvas as contrasted to the ‘cool’, more inert quality of the monochromatic, black and white photographic element, and thus they make a figurative effect against the pictorial ground. Other than the fact that they are all rectangular segments ‘cut from the whole’, they are limited in number and are clustered together so that they replace the approximate area of the canvas in which the photographic segment is missing. Yet despite the limits that this almost systematic function might seem to place on the spontaneous ges-ture that could be suggested by these painted (actually ‘impressed’) elements, they do in fact produce a sensuous and pictorially expressive reciprocity with the work as a whole. The contrasts of colour and tone between the painted ground and the woodblock impression, between the chromatic and textu-ral contrasts of the abstract segments themselves, and in the interplay between their rectangularity and the rectangular forms that shape the architectural features of the photographic portion of the images, characterizes what I would identify as ‘painterly’ in the classic sense; that is, as representation primarily concerned with the construction of pictorial space through gestural mark-making.

However, by giving the painted sections a more active part than its previous metaphorical function as the ‘ground’ to the ‘figurative’ or signifying function of the photograph, I have reconfigured the painted segments to now function as the figure, with the photograph as the ground. Some impli-cations of this inversion will be elaborated upon later in the discussion of the subsequent work, EI Taller. This raises some theoretical questions that have yet to be fully answered. What, for example, are the implications of this for the relative hierarchical relationships between painting and photo-graphy as it has evolved historically? Is this a repositioning in my work of painting as a signifying gest-ralism in itself? Until this point ‘gesturalism’ has always been repressed in my work and is, in my opi-nion, the most problematic aspect of painterly technique. In more general terms, does this constitute a fundamental shift in my work? Whatever the case, the ‘hermeneutic substance’, the significantly readable aspect of the subject matter given by the photographic element in these works, assumes a new relation to abstraction. Even though the theme of the studio references the production of the work itself, the absence in these works of the human figure, the artist as ‘actor’, protagonist, and producer, sublimates the ‘figurative’ function of the photograph as a signifying representation to the relatively more dynamic painterly per-formance of the abstract segments. The author as producer here is present not as a self-legitimizing ‘hero’, but as an ‘absence’ looking back through the ‘space of production’, reflecting on work in the process of its self-definition.

Self-reflection on the process of production, which is a testimony to a form of modernist pathology, is even more accentuated in the second work of these related works, /El Taller/. Although it is a reprise of the first series (it consists of four canvases of the same dimensions and of the same studio photographed six years later) there are some fundamental differences: the photographs are in colour and the abstract segments in black and white, a reversal of the system in /Corner of the Studio/; there are four distinct photographs, while in the first series a single photograph was cut into four parts; and the imagery shows the actual process, materials and production of the canvases themselves, while the first showed only the space of future production.

The four photographs of /El Taller/, taken in the summer of 1993, document the space of the studio in a precisely determined structure, with distinct angle shots that combine to represent a unified space, specifically work tables and a wall, against which stretched canvases are propped. These canva-ses are the very same ones upon which their own photographic images are laminated. The four dis-tinct photographs, each laminated onto a canvas of identical dimensions, were shot from slightly different positions but clearly describe a continuous space, a coherent geography of objects and architecture. This structure in itself is not necessarily significant from an interpretive point-of-view, but does involve the attentive spectator in a comprehension of the unity of the work through close observation of the photographic information. The self referencing of the photographic ‘ground’ is also effected by the referencing of the tools of production (ladder, tables, stretcher bars, canvas, plier, stapler, etc.) and their relative positions in the image so that the ‘topography’ of the photographic space can thus present these objects as figurative emblems that refer to a particular stage in the production process, that is, in the preparation of the canvas ground only, for in fact neither the photographic nor the painting process in itself are represented. There is an emphasis on the ground then, that draws attention to the problematic of ‘figure-ground’ relations that are central to this series and all works on canvas related to it.

There is an ironic effect produced by the fact that this emphatic reference to the canvas support as pictorial ground is conveyed specifically by the photographic element that covers most of the sur-face of each canvas. Since now the photographic surface has becomes the ‘ground’ for the ‘pain-terly’ figuration of the woodblock impressions, the history of photographic practice which has provided a competitive and often opposing force to the traditional dominance of painting and the materiality of the canvas support, now ironically acts as a reifying and ‘affirmative’ reference. Just as text subscribes image, here photography subscribes paintings: — it confirms its existence through mechanical representation. However, it would not be entirely accurate to say that this reifying and affirmative effect ceases to be critical of these relations. Rather, through the ‘displacement’ of the ‘ideal’ ground of painting (the white, virginal space of the primed canvas) by the ‘vulgar' specificity of photographic representation, this ironic reversal provides the opportunity for reflection upon the relative status of the pictorial arts and what we might call the ‘idea of the picture’, the discursive logos of modern thought as represented in the image. The referencing power of photography has returned to the ‘deconstru-ted’ materiality of painting and its canvas support the possibility of representation that was lost when painting, and especially its ‘gestural’ rhetoric, was superceded by the ‘industrialization’ of pictorial representation through mechanical reproduction such as photography and film. Now painting in its idealist dimension is ironically affirmed, and its reductive material dimension fetishized, through the intervention of photography.

But the point that must be acknowledged here is that painting, even in its most idealized and essentialist aesthetics is not ‘immaculately conceived’: — it is itself a technical invention, materially and manually produced to function as the dominant form of pictorial representation throughout most of the history that established its privileged position as the ‘horizon of meaning’ in western high culture, that is, as ‘the idea of the picture’; and that photographic representation continues this logos in a modernized mode of production. In the historical displacement of its representational function by the mechanical means of representation (photography, film, video, etc.) painting fell back on its histori-cally-evolved status as the ideal essentialist space of meaning — that of modernist abstraction. These works in part are shifting this idealist space of painting over to a technical, material discourse and thus to an ‘expressive’ discourse filtered through mechanical process.

This displacement produces a critical reference to the problematic relations that still remain between the legitimacy of painting and photography as constituted in the discourse of high art. My particular position on this issue is briefly stated as follows: that the ideal space of painting as an historically produced space of potential meaning, as the ‘ground of signification’, can be itself also a ‘material effect’ — that is, that the ‘poetics’ of painting, rendered apparently obsolete by the vulgar specificity of the mechanical representation of the ‘real’, can be recuperated, needs to be recuperated, as a functio-nal element in the construction of significant, historically compelling meaning. This recuperation of the conversion of the ideality of painting into a material effect is carried out through the dialectical and critical (and ironic, for what is given away is also taken back) contestation of representational function of both painting and photography (its arch-rival in the static visual arts at least) in the field of the picture.

Yet to continue questioning the logic of this displacement: — if photography now assumes the position of the ground of representation in the horizon of the pictorial field — what becomes of painting now that it is pushed out into the foreground as ‘figuration’, but still stripped of its representational capability? A description of how this functions in the ‘abstract’ segments of the canvasses of /El Taller/ follows.

In each canvas of /El Taller/ the abstract painterly elements are composed of an arrangement of only two rectangular sections, or elongated bars, one of which has an impression of a plywood texture in white ink on a white acrylic field, and the other of a plywood impression in black ink on a white acrylic field, forming a syntax of contrasts. The textural fields are monotype impressions taken by rubbing the canvas directly onto inked plywood. These rectangles are not in fact (although they might at first appear to be) superimposed over the photographic ground, but instead the photograph has been physically cut away at this point, revealing the canvas texture, and allowing the abstract sections to make an intrusion into the photographic field so that they project aggressively into the space of the image, charging it with a dynamic potentiality.

There is in this movement a residual rhetoric that flows from the relations between these figurations. It is possible that this rhetorical element stems from the sublimation of painterly gesture to dominantly mechanical processes in the photographic (printed and laminated in a laboratory) and wood monoprint (directly transferred without any intentional gestural articulations) elements. And because there is almost never any painterly gesture as such in my work, rhetorical figuration emerges indirectly and at the extremes of the pictorial vocabulary, both in the general organization of theme and form, and often in apparently incidental details of the photographs. Even the textures of the natural grain of the wood impression is produced by pressure of the feet, but for the most part the ‘rhetorical drama’ of what is latent as painterly figuration is contained in a dynamic but controlled equilibrium between the abstract sections and the spatial unity of the photographic ground, which, as the more potent representational field, already has a superfluity of gestural movements on its own. The visual thrusts and parries, the luminous textures, the contrasts of tone and chroma; all contribute to a painterly vocabulary latent in both the abstract and photograph elements. But overriding all those movements that carry a figurative function, there is the opticality of the work — the illusions of virtual space carried by the material difference between the photographic imagery and the woodblock monoprint; both of which articulate space in a forceful but distinct way. This ‘opticality’ is reinforced by various contrapuntal spatializing deuces in both the photgraphic and abstract sections. Thus the eye is ‘trapped’ into plotting the logic of virtual space, the mirroric simulation of actual space that is the essential opticality of the photographic domain.

What is important to me in these works, as the outcome of a formal experiment in effect, is that this optical complexity derives from a few direct, opaque, almost granular (in the sense that the illu-sion of deep space is, upon close inspection, confounded by the clearly visible grain of the canvas sur-face) technical devices — a self-reflexive, theoretically problematic visuality produced by an economy of means This opticality engages the devices which produce it. This is a ‘process of seeing which invites the spectator to become an ‘optical producer’ as well as spectator — creating a theater for contemplation upon the act of seeing and the mechanics of representation. This interactive drama plays out what is essential to all radical pictorial art, not the formulation of frozen iconic emblems that ‘illustrate’ ideas, but the active recognition (I stress the dynamic aspect here — ‘seeing it new’) in the ‘minds eye’ during the contemplation of pictorial art of our own comparative experiences of the visual complexity of everyday life. New pictorial art provides the ‘codes’ for experience. It tunes the eye. This fundamental function is the ‘grounding’ of experiential rationality. As such it is truly classical, but also modern in its experimental self-consciousness, so that the process of seeing itself comes again under examination as a subject for pictorial art — as it did during the experiment with linear perspectival systems of representation as formulated by Alberti in the 18th century, and the dissolution of these perspective systems in the evolution of modernist abstraction, in particular during the early years of cubism.

/Corner of the Studio/ and /El Taller/, and other works related to them, apart from their co-nection to the subject of the studio as a place of production, are part of a digression in my work as a whole, a digression from thematic models of subject matter that still dominate most of my work, towards an experimental reflection on technical problems and a theorization of means essential to modernist art of all kinds. Yet there still remains an unresolved problematic in this work, which can only be answered in time and through the development of new work: that of the limits of the aesthetic as well as the technical models that inform these pieces. That is to say, the models of vision provided by both painting and photography (the ‘static’ visual arts) have been substantially superceded by new technology: cinema, video, television and computer generated imagery. Nevertheless, the aesthetic dimension, the grounding of the medium itself in an ‘idealist’ or ‘essentialist’signification that transcends the spectacular power or the new media, remains, in my view, an indispensable element in the legitimacy of contemporary art.

Artist's Statement - Bert Weir A long time ago I began working very close with nature attempting to understand various feelings sent to me by the warm earth smells the sound of leaves the movement of clouds the growth of all organic things the wind activated movement the motion and sound of waters the light change and most of all the spiritual relations between all of these things and me

I began painting spiritual impressions and worked through stages where I would hear trees communicating feel wind spirits blend with the water movement and enjoy the ever-changing pigmentation in the plants

After forty-five years of painting in this direction a change

Influenced by native thought exploring my Celtic background I became aware of a common rhythm flowing through nature, the ancients, and earthmother

The change has created the need for expanded expression Where will it lead?

While I have designed and installed 28 public art projects, it is my most recent environmental designs that I wish to talk about here to best give a sense of how I might approach future projects from an aesthetic and philosophical point of view. My work often uses light and wind to animate and transform the designed environment as the viewer moves through it.

In each of these current projects some aspect of the natural world has been brought to our attention in the form of patterns, textures or the play of wind and light. I am working to create a new vocabulary of image that marries the materials and structure of the built world with the beauty of natural elements and energy.

For the Mesa Arts Center, my work LIGHT STORM which will be installed in 2005 is made of tens of thousands of stainless steel discs that are set into paving indoors and out over an area of 27,000 square feet. The reflective pattern of these discs describes waves and vortices as if these points of light had rained down from the perforated metal sun screens and been blown into natural patterns by a strong desert wind. LIGHT STORM has no mass. It exists as reflected light and surrounding color.

Created for a pedestrian corridor next to the new Bellair building in downtown Toronto, the work LIGHT WIND proposes a series of white sails held in frames that follow the curve of a wave. These sails lift and ripple as the wind moves across them. Beneath the sails filtered light protects pedestrians from the summer sun. In winter, tiny white LED lights on metal mesh replace the sails; the lights forming their own wave patterns and ripples. Contact person Catherine Williams 416-961-9388. This work a proposal only.

I am currently beginning fabrication for two works at two different sites along the old Camino Real in Santa Fe, I was inspired by an ancient Native American image of two spirals that intertwine. These spirals suggest the Spanish and Native American cultures that became intertwined as a result of the trail. The work is entitled TRAIL OF DREAMS, TRAIL OF GHOSTS. One work is a dome in a city park is a light stencil of interpenetrating images from the religious beliefs of both cultures. The sun reveals the images woven together in the shadows cast on the surface below. Etched into the intertwining stone walls at the second site are images depicting the goods brought into the Indian world by the Spanish. These only become apparent as sunlight rakes across the surface. A large mosaic of stone, brass, concrete and glass depicts the voyage along the trail in a symbolic way.

For a park near the new Broncos stadium in Denver, the work PASS THROUGH THE LAND was recently completed. I brought the rough textures and rich colors of the mountains into the urban environment. The massive boulders are set into concentric rings to suggest a labyrinth or maze, an ancient symbol of passage. Natureís forms are translated and ordered. At the entrance to this stone work are five 28 foot high towers with perforated metal silhouettes of aspen trees animated by hundreds of stainless discs hanging in the openings of the mesh. The wind creates wind chimes and a shimmering play of light. Visitors to the park pass beneath this grove and through the stone circles on their way to Invesco At Mile High Stadium.

I am currently designing a childrenís play area/artwork for the new Toronto airport where I have created a maze made of nylon scrim on which images of clouds have been printed. The rectangular volume is very much man-made but the translucent layers of cloud image is natureís beauty translated. At the heart of the maze is a central area where a fog machine has created a real cloud in which the children can play.

Transit stations have the potential for the kind of interactive environments that I enjoy creating as the traffic flow determines the experience of the work in potentially interesting ways.

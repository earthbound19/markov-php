The Centro Cultural Montehermoso Kulturunea, in accordance with its desire to support creation and research in contemporary art and thought, announces a call for entries for a series of grants. The objective of this initiative, which is promoted by the Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council, is to facilitate the production of thirteen selected projects in the following categories.*100 Artists See God* continues the ICA's investigation into new exhibition models that confront issues relevant to the wider concerns of today's world. In a time where major belief systems clash against each other, often resulting in violent and tragic conflict, the ICA presents this exhibition as a response to Western society's seemingly unquestionable belief in a rational understanding of the world. *100 Artists See God* proposes an open ended contemplation of highly complex reveal idiosyncratic, unexpected viewpoints, the exhibition allows viewers to formulate their own thoughts and concerns by simultaneously revealing and questioning the place of God today and showing how issues of spirituality thread their way through the entire fabric of international culture.

La première occupe un espace carré au sol et est composée de neuf blocs placés à quelques centimètres les uns des autres, suivant un quadrillage régulier. Leurs faces externes sont blanchies, de façon inégale; les faces internes, brutes, laissent évident leur mode de construction. Ensemble, ils ne forment qu'un seul volume, fragmenté. Leurs dimensions sont à peu près semblables, leurs hauteurs varient un peu. Les dessus des blocs sont grossièrement hachurés, grugés, sillons ou vagues qui creusent dans la surface une dépression.

As part of his participation in Performa09, the third visual art performance biennial of New York City, artist Darius Miksys invites the parents of artists to a group meeting to ponder the unanswerable—how, why, and when did my child become an artist? The goal of this social interaction on November 21, 2-4 pm is not to solve this mystery, but rather to explore the generational move backward as a creative forward-looking exercise. Miksys is, after all, interested in exploring communicative models and turning the tables around.

In the seventies and eighties Bolduc was celebrated as a bright star in the constellation of Canadian art. He was a heralded exhibitor in Andrew Hudson's /14 Canadians/ that introduced progressive Canadian Art at the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington. He held annual solo exhibitions dating from the early seventies; his works are in the collections of public collections from coast to coast. Of late, many have turned their gaze away from the visual pleasures of formalism. Recently, Bolduc completed and mounted a final show for Christopher Cutts Gallery, Toronto. Confident mastery of his craft combines with a humble acceptance of his personal place within art's cosmos; the final show is a triumph of the personality as well as of the hand.

Janet Logan's work is based on making research into identity and memory. To do this, she must look back over her life, but this also means she has to shape, interpret and invent her past. The titles of some of her individual exhibitions are revealing of her concerns, such as /M�moires et r�ves, Sucrerie et conte de f�es, Mythes, m�moires et r�alit�s /, as well as the title of one work /Elle a �t� �lev�e dans du coton (She was given a sheltered life) /. Who is Janet Logan? A woman, a feminist, a designer of costumes for the theatre, a painter, a visual artist creating installations, a translator, an Anglophone who moves in a Francophone milieu not to mention her particular character traits, which are not the subject of our reflection but which are an integral part of her identity.

Created for a pedestrian corridor next to the new Bellair building in downtown Toronto, the work LIGHT WIND proposes a series of white sails held in frames that follow the curve of a wave. These sails lift and ripple as the wind moves across them. Beneath the sails filtered light protects pedestrians from the summer sun. In winter, tiny white LED lights on metal mesh replace the sails; the lights forming their own wave patterns and ripples. Contact person Catherine Williams 416-961-9388. This work a proposal only.

/Uniquely beautiful and enduring-and so ruthlessly difficult; platinum prints are reserved for the finest images, of the most skilled photographers, who make them in small amounts for a special reason. This have been true from the birth of photography to the present day./
So I contain it in the square, with quicksilver paint that sets up as fast as you can put it down. "oh and I remember something you once told me, and I'll be damned if it did not come true: twenty thousand roads that I went down down down and they all led me straight back home to you."
While Jackson Pollock's leading role in the Abstract Expressionist movement has been widely discussed, less attention has been devoted to his black paintings period. In describing this pivotal phase in Pollock's artistic trajectory, the critic and historian Michael Fried remarked that "[Pollock is] on the verge of an entirely new and different kind of painting...of virtually limitless potential." The black paintings assembled for the exhibition will include significant loans from US, Asian, and European collections, as well as important works drawn from the collections of the DMA and Tate. plates, an artist chronology, a black painting chronology, an exhibition checklist, and a number of, as yet, unpublished photographs by Hans Namuth of the black paintings.

I identify closely with the materials I use and the compositional devices I employ; structural fragmentation, glazes, three-dimensional and two-dimensional space, and colour. I use these materials and devices for their inherent natural and abstract characteristics, sensual and textural aspects, and for their symbolic qualities.

In reviewing the written terms of the numbered treaties it is shocking to note the vast tracts of landed ceded by, and the pittance reserved for, Native tribes. It is telling to examine how the terms of the treaties changed between the signing of Treaties 1 and 2 in Manitoba in 1871 and the last of the numbered treaty adhesions signed in 1954 and 1956. Slowly, the Government began paying just a little more attention to the positions of Native negotiators. Even more telling are the terms of the Agreement in Principle signed by the Nisga'a of British Columbia and the Federal Government in 1996. The Nisga'a demanded, fought long and hard for and finally won, a fair deal.

Murky, hot color, lush paint handling, and dry, broken surfaces trigger associations with Venetian prototypes without reproducing them. Space is unstable; "foreground" and "background" change places. Figures, gestures, even narratives are implied but not depicted-sometimes, a human presence survives as just a memory.

*Hu Fang—Towards a Non-Intentional Space* There is a modest power that applies to both the art of gardens and that of farming, both of which reference natural laws of nourishment, preservation, and anticipation; although they are not revolutionary formulas, they both oppose contempt for life. As I see it, the art of the garden and the art of farming have always been concealed within the progress of modernity, but for a long time we have had no means to encounter them, no capacity for listening to the sounds of their presence.  

This push pull of beauty, cliché, comfort and contradiction is active in much of my recent work. The previous exhibition /Road trip Diary/Journal de route/ played with the familiar aesthetic of postcards and family photographs and the experience of tourism and family holidays.

Since architecture is so fundamentally nostalgic it has not been able to develop a discourse and an ideology that accepts the real conditions that cities offer now. The architectural profession is stuck, which forces it to almost reject anything that really happens and to design public space in a neurotic and authoritarian way. The other space that architects and thinkers about architecture neglect in terms of not reflecting on it is the political system, which enters the picture with incredible brutality.  
A discussion on the contested terrain of open source culture online, and how new models and practices offer innovative artistic and political possibilities to some, and questionable author- and ownership complications to others. Panelists from different disciplines and backgrounds will explore the effects of online platforms such as Wikipedia and delicious on culture and offline systems of knowledge, as well as current challenges to open source principles such as net neutrality.

Using a provocative character, the Artist represents an "alternative femininity" with a trasgressive approach; going through a different sexual identity the Artist intends to represent femininity as a human attitude rather than a straight sexual orientation.

Thus institutions end up filled with those who want nothing more than to destroy them—the European Parliament a shell stuffed with people shouting about how pointless it all is and how the whole thing should just be abolished. It is consequently possible to imagine every existing institution occupied by those who most want it abolished—prisons are already such a place, or schools, perhaps—but the banks are not yet filled with anticapitalists.

I am most often described as being a landscape painter, and I suppose I am, but I am not of the 'scenic' variety. I don't seek out and record the novel or search for impressive natural splendour to depict. I consider that a form of 'artistic tourism', getting a small taste of an alien locale, recording quick sketches of a place you have no real connection to, and then elaborating the theme from faint and passing impressions. The result, more often than not, is that you create mole-hills out of mountains.

In the late seventies and early eighties, I was acutely aware of my precarious position: I was a young woman painting; working in a predominantly male art-form, trying to overturn my position as Object and reclaim the territory of female sexuality. While working in New York in 1979, I began investigating the most extreme form of feminine objectification, (ultimately human objectification), to be found in the mass media: pornography and prostitution. I had to abandon my brushes and put myself in front of the camera in a piece of what I, at the time, called "life art". I modeled for an ad for a brothel in /Screw/ magazine. I used a blowup of the ad in an installation piece in an exhibition titled /Destroy Those Pictures /at ChromaZone in 1981. My direct experience with pornography allowed me to become a "conscious" Object. This was necessary for me to feel justified in using pornographic imagery in my paintings; not as a voyeur but as a participant.

At the foot of Spadina Road in Toronto, sail boats were stored for winter with their hulls up on wooden cradles and covered with tarps. I used black and white photography to capture the forms as abstract compositions then rendered them in paint with arbitrary colour. Mixed media of canvas, wood, wire and string give them a semblance of the materials seen on the original site.

Fast opens his film with an interview with the drone operator as he recounts his combat experiences of flying over Afghanistan and Pakistan. Speaking mostly off-camera, the drone operator details the psychological impact of engaging an enemy from thousands of miles away. Switching between documentary interview footage and fictionalized re-enactments, Fast creates a multifaceted and unstable sense of reality. Combined with surreal shots of suburban Nevada, the film offers a subtle exploration of how the use of drones is rapidly changing the politics, principles and personal experience of contemporary conflict. 

Coming from scientific research where I studied cell normal and abnormal development and spent many hours looking at cells to see when a variant was abnormal. Later as a weaver and artist working in textiles, the language of pattern became a main interest, how do fabrics such as pins stripes suits, jeans and kitchen towels communicate as patterns (rather than objects) Mostly then my interest was in disrupting those patterns or making our automatic reading of them evident. Also in my hand weaving I focused on patterns that were interesting (again on the microscopic level) i.e. patterns with as many colours as possible and patterns that evolved dynamically to create narratives.

Although both of these artists explore the traditions of drawing and painting in highly individual and very distinctive manners, it can be said that both bodies of work display an undeniable ability to investigate shape and form whilst demonstrating an intense love of the chosen medium and its possibilities for illusion, complexity, intricacy, With the systematic pursuance of this approach and the concentrated addition of abstract-constructivist, conceptual and minimalist positions through to the present, the DaimlerChrysler Collection has been given a clearly defined profile which is well founded in art history terms.Arp, Vordemberge-Gildewart and Vantongerloo. In the group of constructivist and concrete art, we have integrated recent works by Reyle, Rockenschaub, Hiepler, Gillick and Monk, which can be related in different ways to the formal vocabulary and analytical pictorial concepts of the classical artists.In relation to the notion of stardom, the exhibition Gee how glamorous offers exemplary representations of the central production mechanisms and strategies employed by Warhol in his life and art, as well as in the complex universe of the Factory. During the past decades there have been innumerable thematic shows of Warhols work, yet most of them offered classical interpretations by focussing on particular themes and/or group of works within his oeuvre. Gee how glamorous proposes a different view of Warhols work from a contemporary perspective. It seeks to posit questions of identity and its construction, self-perception and the perception of others in relation to theatrical as well as documentary strategies. Beyond paintings, films and photographs by Andy Warhol, the exhibition also presents a variety of documentary photos, archive material and recordings from Warhols immediate surroundings. The overall presentation consciously doing almost entirely without origin! All works by Andy Warhol furthermore investigates the value and aura of the original. and a love of detail. In his embroideries nostalgic memory and a distanced, removed stance are forced into a critical reciprocal interrelationship.

/Paysage, etc. / occupe deux espaces bien précis (sol et air) pour former un tout homogène. Janet Logan empile au sol sur des coffres ou des chevalets telles des poupées, des peluches ou des coussins, des parties du corps humain qu'elle a réalisées à partir de vêtements, en camaïeu de blanc, qu'elle a défaits et recousus. Elle a crée des objets indéterminés, suspendus au plafond et qui, juxtaposés les uns près des autres forment un tout qui de prime à bord semble empreint de douceur et de légèreté, mais certaines des textures plus hérissés, entre autres le métal, s'opposent à ce qui est moelleux et réconfortant. Cette tension ainsi créé n'est aucunement menaçante, mais semble être le résultat d'une certaine anxiété. D'autre part, ce procédé d'exposition par suspension, amplement utilisé au XXe siècle, était déjà fort prisé au XVIe siècle - par exemple, dans les cabinets de curiosité on suspendait du plafond les objets les plus étonnants.

/Transition/ My current work continues an investigation into the formal relationship between painting and photography, focusing on the architecture and landscape of freeways and the buffer of land between the city and the countryside. The transition, dislocation and isolation that I experience driving through this sprawling landscape are used in the work as a metaphor for broader feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.

In 1992 I co-founded Dasart, an artist's collective dedicated to socialist installations. We suppressed individual identities, mounting several national and international traveling exhibitions. 'Dasart/Victoria' installation contrasted 19th Century optimism with the late 20th Century industrial age detritus. We used old colonial maps, coal, concrete, iron and rubber with motors, sound and electricity to create a frenetic environment, contrasted with serene Victorian paintings.

I am currently beginning fabrication for two works at two different sites along the old Camino Real in Santa Fe, I was inspired by an ancient Native American image of two spirals that intertwine. These spirals suggest the Spanish and Native American cultures that became intertwined as a result of the trail. The work is entitled TRAIL OF DREAMS, TRAIL OF GHOSTS. One work is a dome in a city park is a light stencil of interpenetrating images from the religious beliefs of both cultures. The sun reveals the images woven together in the shadows cast on the surface below. Etched into the intertwining stone walls at the second site are images depicting the goods brought into the Indian world by the Spanish. These only become apparent as sunlight rakes across the surface. A large mosaic of stone, brass, concrete and glass depicts the voyage along the trail in a symbolic way.

*_Boris Groys—_*_*On Art Activism*_ <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/on-art-activism/> There is no doubt that we are living in a time of total aestheticization. This fact is often interpreted as a sign that we have reached a state after the end of history, or a state of total exhaustion that makes any further historical action impossible. However, as I have tried to show, the nexus between total aestheticization, the end of history, and the exhaustion of vital energies is illusionary. Using the lessons of modern and contemporary art, we are able to totally aestheticize the world—i.e., to see it as being already a corpse—without If the excess of ultranationalism demands that we stand whenever the national anthem is played, or that we cheer in the loudest voice every act of triumphant chest-beating, it may well be time for us to continue sitting where we are precisely because we love the ground that we sit on, and to do so quietly, since sedition sometimes speaks in whispers.

Now being held for the third time, the Tirana Biennale, has not only established itself as an international art event, but also plays a significant role in the process of growth taking place in Albania, a country that has intuited to what extent culture can represent a point of departure, rather than one of arrival, in economic development. In conjunction with its forthcoming issue's theme section, /Cabinet/ magazine is inaugurating "The Accident," a series of programs that will examine how the "accidental event" has been understood in the philosophical, cultural, and scientific imagination since early modernity. Of little intellectual value until then because of its apparently insignificant singularity, the accident has since the 17th century been recast into an occurrence that raises fundamental questions about the way the world is ordered. issues but has actually provoked, and in court defended, them: concepts such as intellectual property issues, file sharing, media literacy, creative activism in a media-saturated multinational world, evolving notions of art and ownership, and law in a digital age.

Over the past few years I have turned to the works of artists such as Chardin, Morandi, de Chirico, Magritte, Anselm Keifer, Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse. It is the mood, emotion and intellect of their works that I respond to. Keeping within the spirit of the above-mentioned artists I create works that are evocative and non-moralizing.

The theme of the studio has appeared constantly in my work since 1969 when I began documenting my workspace in a way that related the intellectual aspects of conceptual art with direct references to the material production of the art object, a self-consciously modernist strategy which still informs my work. As the space of production — the specific location of the construction of artwork in both the material and intellectual sense, as the place where the idea is produced as an object for con-templation and distribution — the image of the studio functions as a pictorial grounding of the concep-tual aspects of my work. From the beginning, this ‘objectivication of thought was established also as an intellectual montage', a link between literary material and a physical, technical process associated with objectness. The image of a random assembly of books and writing materials on a table occurs throughout the subsequent development of my work: this can be seen in /Summer Script/ (1973) , /Image / text/ (I979), /Art Work/ (1983), /In the Studio/ (1984), /Studio / Museum / Street/ (1986), /The Idea of the University/ (1990), and in most of the works of my ‘Hotel series' in which hotel rooms became a workspace while travelling. The theme of the studio also acts as a personal chronicle and self-reflection on the work itself in relation to the objective social space of the other two recurring the-matic locations that appear in my work: the museum and the street.

In this series of paintings by Toronto artist, Gyula Kalko, the appropriated details of familiar works from the history of Western art illustrate deeply rooted parallels and connections of the human condition between past and present societies. The simulated x-ray panels (a byproduct of scientific scrutiny used in art conservation) work as a formal device through which historical distance, and a sense of detachment from the past, is established and the ambiguity of the connection with the present is communicated. The sections painted realistically and in full colour represent contemporary society and deal with subject matter that effects all of us.

After the show, I returned home to paint.

The conceptual elements of monochrome, the objectification of paint pigments, the reflection of colour, movement and form, become central in the artist's research, and are codified and translated into a new metaphysics of the painted surface, in a new form of abstraction, strongly lyrical, where the reference to photography appears evident.

Marman and Borins have been invited to speak at a number of galleries and institutions, including: the National Gallery of Canada, The Power Plant's Hub-Bub series, the Art Gallery of Ontario, University of Toronto, the Ontario College of Art and Design and Syracuse University.

/Interior with Fig tree/ and /Tao is Back/ are about a period of time before I separated from my husband. I wanted to express the bleakness and sense of uncertainty that I felt through images of my interior spaces that I loved. These paintings have animated plants with sinister expression. Claustrophobic interiors in shades of black /greens, touches of violet, ochre and teal intend to have an expression is of tension, strength and stillness in the face of uncertainty.

Furthermore, in the earlier work titled /Corner of the Studio/, the image represents the studio as a place for intellectual production only in an indirect way. Unlike other works of this type (eg. the ‘/Hotel/ series'), there is not even any paperwork in evidence, only boxed musical and recording equipment, and a single open book on the divan. Yet the various objects and furniture in the image do indicate potential activity: the forementioned book, musical equipment, an ashtray and a case of beer. Industrial buildings can be seen through the window. The open book, on the edge of the divan next to the chair (largely obscured) where I had been sitting, is in fact, although indecipherable as such in the photograph, ‘/Un Coup de Dés/' by Stephane Mallarmé, a book which, over the past twenty years, has functioned for me as a cipher for abstraction as a poetic concept, for the concept of the ‘unreadable' at those moments when there seems to be ‘nothing to say'.

*The Bureau d'études* (F) shows the latest in a series of works that make the usually invisible links between the institutions that shape our lives (industry, governmental agencies) visible. Alice Creischer & Andreas Siekmann (USA/G) show a series of collaborative works that use the forms and language of Neurath and Arntz to ask questions of contemporary relevance. Stephan Dillemuths (G) recent work is concerned with groups that came to be collectively known as the Life Reform Movement.  puts up a discussion about a money-driven world using cartoon-like imagery.The past remembered or rather memorised? Based on facts or feelings? Material or immaterial? In his 1981 feature film, The Man of Iron, Andrzej Wajda re-enacted the scenes memorised from famous photographs and TV news items from the strikes in Gdansk Shipyard. He mixed up staged situations with genuine documentary recordings, making not only a movie but, more importantly, a significant operation on the collective memory. Along with the famous Solidarnosc logo by Jerzy Janiszewski, the film lays the foundations of the international visual legacy of the 1980s in Poland. Aneta Szylak, the curator, takes these two artefacts as points of departure for Dockwatchers, building the intellectual premises of the exhibition on re-enactment, revision of symbolic values as well as visible and invisible shifts in cultural memory.

My practice is an excavation of the detritus of everyday life. I borrow methodology from archaeology, anthropology, and natural history. Through an activity parallel to that of the museum, I collect, catalogue, and (re)present objects. I seek relationships between nature and culture, creation and production, what is lost and what is found. ‘museum piece' combines several bodies of work in an on-going catalogue which samples the nature in our culture and the culture in our nature.

Realizing this avant-garde sensibility consists of a change of perspective within given conditions, not necessarily in the change of the conditions. It opposes the passive nihilism of society's death drive, and the fundamental tendency of the symbolic order to perpetuate the same through continual displacement. In doing so it contests the basic conceits of linear time: the fetishization of history, mythologies that celebrate novelty and dynamic change, and the overriding imperative toward modernization.

Evan Levy's poetry is an amalgamation of the influences processed and transformed by the artist. First of all, Levy is a nationalist and not an-insincere one at that. Apart from his affirmed beliefs about his country and its people's abilities, Levy draws a great deal of inspiration from the northern landscape. He states that, "As a nationalist, Canadian content isn't a choice, it is inevitable that 'Canadian' images are the most powerful for me...Canada is a country of wind and water - these are images of the north" For a city-weaned fellow, Levy captures these images extremely well, albeit with romantic apperception.

These works were initially inspired by Sylvia Earle's book /Sea Changes/ and then through further research on tectonic plates, mountains and creatures of the sea. The creatures of the deep sea, ocean mountain ranges and the process of bio-luminescence are the main concepts behind the images. The movement in these works reflect the experience I had when snorkelling on the great Caribbean reef of being pulled and pushed involuntarily by the power of the ocean. Technically these paintings have expanded in the use of a variety of applications using scrapers, poured paint and over lays on prepared textures. I love these paintings as they were a joy to make. I was submersed in their making.

In biblical times it was greed and megalomania that caused the Tower of Babel to crumble, just as surely as they make fortunes rise and fall today. The fatigue and resignation of the guardsman, captured in a painting by Carel Fabritius, is the same as that of an exhausted and frustrated UN peacekeeper. As the exuberant and provocative parades on Gay Pride Day in cities across North America speak of prevalent social pressures, so the hedonistic bacchanalia processions depicted by Annibale Carracci on the ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese point to the battle of ideologies in 17th century Rome. Whether cloaked in antiquity by Poussin or captured by TV cameras on the streets of Sarajevo, the atrocities and horrors of war outrage us all the same. The possibilities of poignant associations are many.

And so it goes. I intend to continue with this life, these investigative pleasures, discursive discussions with friends, to make music, to keep looking and to keep painting.

An important part of this shift is a change in the status of cultural production in general. Basically, art can no longer be taken to be an automatically good thing. If artworks have for over a century pointed to transformations in political or social consciousness, many artists are now coming to terms with the degree to which artworks are already functionalized as instruments of blunt social and political realities. While these realities might be depressing to idealistic types, or confusing to connoisseurial contemplative types, it would be a shame to miss what a profound reformatting of time we are currently experiencing when the engine of historical progress that defined the modern tradition slows down and bifurcates into the endless mirroring and redistribution of the present time. Technology turns naturalistic and advanced materialist accounts read global swarms of waste products for legible signs, for points where planetary-scale desires start to look structural or infrastructure-ish. The real discovery in all this may in fact be in a slow and relentless unraveling of what a sham the modern tradition may have been the whole time as an era profoundly overstuffed with heroic being boycotted. In many cases the same artists withdrawing their participation are actually extremely interested in the bloodstained funder, the weapons manufacturer, the moral police, or the draconian state policies, which they stand together with other artists to oppose.

Further, the Acrylics of the /Plan for Painting/ Series beginning with No. 24 objectively, and indidually represent different stages in the formation of a diverse range of unique colour schemes. That means a particular cycle of chromatic circumstances is made visible by maintaining a continuity throughout the series regarding its serial format. That, in combination with the technique of painting seventy-five Artists' Finity Acrylic Colours on what ostensibly looks like raw linen results in a wide variation in colour sensation and stage in the movement of colours results in a unique perceptual scheme. In addition, the formal components of the nine squares are comprised of a self-contained repetition of nine consecutive coloured strips complete the chromatic sequence. Lastly, the four short and four long coloured strips that follow the chromatic sequence, and the formal multiplicity of layered configuration of a particular scheme. In that, viewers are provided with the critical means to identity the extent of their subjective experience in relation to their self-conscious perception of the characteristic limit (s) of a particular work in the series.

To take Farocki's preference for the instructional seriously is to embark, joyously, upon an internal exile from much of what understands itself as experimental culture. And now that Farocki is gone, it becomes clear to me that his films, videos, television programs, essays, texts, exhibitions, and interviews provide nothing less than an alternative value system that enables you to encounter the mutation of images in the present.

As with all of my photographs of unsettled world communities, /The Tibetans/ are black-and-white prints meant to capture the timeless isolation of a unique world culture. Many of these images have a dark and somber presence as they were taken inside the mysterious candle-lit sanctuaries of Tibet's Buddhist monasteries.

I find the further away from me a subject is, the less connection and interest I have in it. My satisfaction remains in making 'a mountain out of a molehill'. To me, the smaller a subject is the more monumental it seems. I seldom leave my 160 hectare farm in Bruce county to sketch. It's all here - I'm an extreme regionalist.

This work is the most recent in a series of installations and sculpture and, like previous work is motivated by an interest in the relationship of human beings to nature and material culture. The source for the work is biotechnology and genetic manipulation of nature, which is reshaping our relationship to the natural world in dramatic ways. Increasingly, humans shape nature itself-with the potential for big impacts on our lives and all aspects of daily living.

*_Constanze Ruhm—Attachment_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/attachment/> A simple lesson I learned from Harun Farocki: on set, you can clap the clapboard quietly too.

A space within space- space as something. Timed Based Projections: introduce an object as a temporal element to the Velvet Tarpaulin composition. The abstraction or text that has been painted with extraction fluid on the black velvet tarp depicts space within space existing on its own as the image. A timed slide projection of an object is periodically introduced to the composition for a set amount of time. The object, is temporal and can be seen in part as well as because of the spaces created. Adding the object as projection attempts to alter not invert a historical hierarchy of space/object relation.

How does a life world already constitute a concrete money form? How do we understand and expand permanent incommensurability as the primary non-value of any form of social exchange? What figures does this produce as factors and variables in those exchanges, what does it draw into its vortex? Concentration, distraction, exhaustion, daydreaming, race, suffering, severe pain?
In the gun culture of the United States, firearms are seen as an aid to preserving life. Firearms protect people from their enemies. They are a form of self- defense and a natural right of every individual. This emphasis on self-preservation creates a state of fearful paranoia, which in turn leads to violence.

Today, less than % of fine art photographs are printed in platinum-because it is ten times more costly to the artist, and significantly harder to do.

Self-reflection on the process of production, which is a testimony to a form of modernist pathology, is even more accentuated in the second work of these related works, /El Taller/. Although it is a reprise of the first series (it consists of four canvases of the same dimensions and of the same studio photographed six years later) there are some fundamental differences: the photographs are in colour and the abstract segments in black and white, a reversal of the system in /Corner of the Studio/; there are four distinct photographs, while in the first series a single photograph was cut into four parts; and the imagery shows the actual process, materials and production of the canvases themselves, while the first showed only the space of future production.

Its fury without a target. Or rather, with millions of targets. Over the years Fraser has carefully pruned her work of any cultural specificity, at times using multiple languages, other times appending lists of country names to suggest multiple points of entry. Surprisingly, the effect has been not globalization but individuation. In their inscrutability, these works do not convey a universal suffering so much as they do one womans ongoing struggle to reconcile it with all the lavish beauty in the world.

Conceptual

Since 1994, the Fundación Botín's Visual Arts Grant programme has accommodated 168 artists from around the world, many of who have now made prominent names for themselves in the field. The aim of the This edition of /Itinerarios/ explores the notion of the art piece as an "interface" or a medium that enables the user to visualise a process. For decades, artists have been questioning the idea of the art piece as a product, beyond its exhibition in different venues. They toy with the notion that perhaps the most important aspect of any artistic process resides in the different phases of research and production, as opposed to the traditional concept of the finished work of art that is ready to be received and consumed. 
*Just obsessive, self absorbed, deluded, lonely, dirty, penniless, alcoholic painters discussing what they love most.

Uniquely the editorial remit carries a no advertising policy so there is no distraction from the ranging debate about contemporary painting.

Having just finished my MFA, I decided that I had to either quit painting or learn how to paint all over again. I was teaching in an art school, trying to figure out why people were so insistent on painting from the nude model. This work was an attempt to take apart historical notions of the female nude and its opposite, the armored warrior.

The camera has been tucked away, hidden under a table. The coffin dominates the composition. The picture plane is presented as a symmetrical square that is surrounded by larger black vertical borders on either side, giving the composition a claustrophobic appearance, as if the moving image itself is contained within a box. Schewe manipulates the speed of the footage so that the movement of the mourners alternates between slow and regular motion. At times, the image stops in a freeze frame, perhaps as a way of pointing out the brevity of our time on earth. There are no young people in the video; the mourners are nearly all older. As the mourners move closer to the camera, their legs obscure the composition, and the viewer becomes aware of the intrusive nature of the video. None of the mourners know that they are being recorded, so the camera lens breaches a highly intimate and personal and vulnerable moment.

was that it placed many of the complexities and contradictions of economic problems within a clear and singular binary between capitalism and communism. On top of that, arguments in favor of one or the other had massive geopolitical blocs backing them, and the sheer scale alone was enough to draw any economic argument into the tide of one side or the other. This made it only natural for dominant narratives following the dismantling of communism to profess the triumph of capitalism. However, it is only now that the logic of global capitalism has begun to collapse from within that we are forced to consider the fact that economic value and actual worth have actually been floating on parallel tracks this entire time.

/It is in this sense that the image creates meaning, and one can say that this one created an expression: those of us who saw the photo and were affected by it are now able to chart the course of death walked by this child. Carter's photo is an image of the isthmus that separates life from death. It is thus pain imagined, and pain transformed from an individual and private feeling to a shared and public one./

*_Sven Lütticken—Shine and Schein_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/shine-and-schein/> In his early essay on Wagner, written during the Nazi period, Adorno characterized Wagner's music theatre as "phantasmagoric" precisely because of its basis in commodity fetishism. In trying to create a seamless illusion and a dream-like atmosphere, Wagner prefigured later, more technologically advanced manifestations of the culture industry, while his tableaux on stage recalled contemporaneous displays of consumer goods. In the phantasmagoria, "wird der ästhetische Schein vom Charakter der Ware ergriffen." Wagner's operas are dependent on the concealment of labor, a prerequisite of commodity fetishism.  ** *_Brian Kuan Wood—Is it Heavy or Is it Light?_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/is-it-heavy-or-is-it-light/> Under a regime of visibility that usurps older notions of substance, what figures can we use to affirm its surface effects, to understand its refractive powers, to crack open its hidden energies and make its calculus work for us and not against us? How has this new superficiality realized and flipped the politics of spectacle described by Debord? And why should we take a closer look at the sun?
"The building where the Fondazione's programme has evolved has its roots deep in the industrial heart of the city. A place made of walls, divisions and memories that offered the challenge for a confrontation with oneself, with one's ability and willingness to cross the barriers, physically, conceptually and politically, calling oneself into question to overcome the logic of distance and separation. The multiplicity of points of view has made it possible not only to seek to look for answers but above all to recognise the uncertainties. Artists are experts in accelerating the important issues that arise from being human. They strip down culture to make it appear as it really is."  –Beatrice Merz initiating new curatorial practices by inviting the audience to act and react; combining knowledge and sensory experiments; anticipating and explaining social, ecological, and philosophical changes… through the use of a remarkably broad variety of reproducible media, ranging from sound, video, photographs and slide projections to prints, silkscreens and tapestries.

*_Walid Raad—_*_*Appendix XVIII: Plates 22–257*_ <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/appendix-xviii-plates-22-257/>** It seems that when some colors, lines, shapes, and forms sense the forthcoming danger, they somehow just leap, or jump, or drift, or somehow "abandon" their present location to take refuge in certain documents that circulate around artworks. They are no longer within those artworks, but in documents that circulate around them.

Also featured in the exhibition are 30 works on paper made by Pollock during the same period as the black paintings. Made with enamel and ink and watercolor, the works on paper are considered by scholars to be the artist's most important as a draftsman. The exhibition will also feature five of Pollock's extant six sculptures, which provide a true three-dimensional experience of his well-known painting approach. Together with the 37 paintings on view, these works immerse audiences in Pollock's complete oeuvre and shed new light on the experimentation and ingenuity that has become synonymous with his practice. 

So the artist working under these conditions may discover a certain pleasure in the violent spectacle of annihilation. In the sheer scale of its consequences, she may understand the megalomaniac thrill of having a stake in the architecture of planetary despair. Incapable of modesty, the artist in this situation might only find the means to abandon a bloated humanist positivism for a turbocharged death drive. But we should be careful not to get too excited here. Because in this situation we are not really witnessing the death of humanism so much as the thrill of seeing what it might do in reverse. Which might be a muffled cry for the promises of a classical humanism.

5. The negative is placed in direct contact with the paper, held down under a sheet of heavy glass. Platinum is so stable, that even in a photosensitive salt, it is reluctant to change. To expose a platinum print requires hundreds of times more energy than a silver print. The exposure time may vary from minutes to a full hour, depending upon many variables, due to the density of the negative.

Evan Levy's cold rolled steel sculptures appeal to our tactile as well as poetic sensibilities. His work is strong, tense and assertive while at the same time, lyrical and sublime. Levy's eye gripping sculptures confront the viewer with their strength, but leave us feeling ambiguous in that they appear to be on the verge of springing apart under the stress employed by the artist. These are precarious works which leave the viewer to doubt their weightiness. They appear to have a life all of their own. Levy's ability to achieve this dichotomy with his material is astounding.

In each canvas of /El Taller/ the abstract painterly elements are composed of an arrangement of only two rectangular sections, or elongated bars, one of which has an impression of a plywood texture in white ink on a white acrylic field, and the other of a plywood impression in black ink on a white acrylic field, forming a syntax of contrasts. The textural fields are monotype impressions taken by rubbing the canvas directly onto inked plywood. These rectangles are not in fact (although they might at first appear to be) superimposed over the photographic ground, but instead the photograph has been physically cut away at this point, revealing the canvas texture, and allowing the abstract sections to make an intrusion into the photographic field so that they project aggressively into the space of the image, charging it with a dynamic potentiality.

The Montreal Massacre in 1990 jarred my attention back to figurative art. The paintings refocused on human representation. /The Nature Paintings /and the interiors are ongoing.

The site at the foot of Castle Mountain still bears traces of this story. It was there that I promised my ancestors to bring the realm of the invisible into the visible, rather than allowing the painful to be paved over by history. On the streets of Banff everyone is on holidays, traveling the scenic routes in their cars, creating bear jams. No one sees the barbed wire lying in the grass like so many thorns in a wild rose bush. This work is part of a larger installation and performance.

Since Fukuyama wrote his essay, he has been considered primarily a free-market ideologist seizing an early chance to declare the dismantling of the Soviet Union as the definitive moral victory of Western capitalist democracy—a kind of master ideology to end all ideologies. But those who once disregarded him should now look more closely at his essay, because it is absolutely prophetic. Of course, Fukuyama was not only writing as an intellectual, but also as a senior policymaker at the US State Department and a former analyst at the RAND Corporation. And while his essay did not officially reflect the views of the American state, it was nevertheless written by a man who was not only close to power, but also possessed the means to implement his declarations. So if it comes across as prophetic, it wouldn't be a coincidence. The essay now reads as a crystal-clear blueprint for a peculiarly murky apolitical nonideological condition that has proven to be incredibly difficult to work from—particularly for artists.

I love living in Toronto where the action is. And, needless to say, I love the north bush and traveling to other countries. But, thanks to the Canada Council, who helped me immeasurably throughout my formative years, it must be said that all my ventures and adventures abroad have consistently reminded me of the beauty and greatness of Canada, my home.

Depuis 1992, sa recherche identitaire se poursuit par la création d'installations où elle utilise des matériaux qui sont en lien avec son passé et habitent son présent : tissu, vêtement, filet, grillage, éponge, cordelette, bouton, pelure d'orange, etc., objets qu'elle trouvent entre autres à l'Armée du Salut. Le travail de la matière, qu'elle transforme au fil de son inspiration et les caractéristiques sensibles de ces matériaux - mollesse, pesanteur, douceur, parfois dureté et densité - s'effectue toujours dans l'abstraction. Son approche offre des similitudes avec celle de Louise Bourgeois et Annette Messager, quoique ces deux artistes travaillent essentiellement dans le registre de la narrativité.

ALBUM/TRACKS B may refer to a photo album which, empty at first, tells a "(hi)story" only once it is filled with pictures, a story to look at, read, and interpret from ever new points of view. The work of Ana Torfs (born in 1963, lives in Brussels) could also be understood as a tribute to certain personalities and events from history, literature, and film whose tracks— hence the title—and traces the artist pursues and endows with new life. development to the sewing machine—and of formal and informal use. The flag serves as a vehicle for political-identical argumentation; but it should also be considered in its materiality—as hardware. 

Painting
My father served his apprenticeship at Rapid Grip and Batten with Jack Bush. They were close friends and, though they apparently had a personal schism when I was young, they maintained a great respect for one another's work. After all, they were two of the best illustrators to come out of that generation. Shortly after my father's apprenticeship, he started his own business, Art Circle Ltd., and became well known as a first-class figure man. It was a small company in the penthouse of a great old building near the Stock Exchange on Bay Street. It's gone now, but had gold embellishments and a European-style elevator. At about the age of eight or nine I began visiting him there on Saturday afternoons (my parents were divorced by then) and I often brought a friend along from my neighbourhood. We'd make our own newspapers, because my father had a typewriter, an amazing machine for a boy. I'd take over a whole office desk on a Saturday when the staff wasn't there, with just my father and maybe a lettering man around, hitting those deadlines.

/Corner of the Studio/ and /El Taller/, and other works related to them, apart from their co-nection to the subject of the studio as a place of production, are part of a digression in my work as a whole, a digression from thematic models of subject matter that still dominate most of my work, towards an experimental reflection on technical problems and a theorization of means essential to modernist art of all kinds. Yet there still remains an unresolved problematic in this work, which can only be answered in time and through the development of new work: that of the limits of the aesthetic as well as the technical models that inform these pieces. That is to say, the models of vision provided by both painting and photography (the ‘static' visual arts) have been substantially superceded by new technology: cinema, video, television and computer generated imagery. Nevertheless, the aesthetic dimension, the grounding of the medium itself in an ‘idealist' or ‘essentialist'signification that transcends the spectacular power or the new media, remains, in my view, an indispensable element in the legitimacy of contemporary art. (January 1994, revised March 1995)

Marina Warner explores *Maya Derens* oeuvre and examines how she managed the profound affinity between the material properties of film and inner states of mind.

Art education, on the other hand, has deeply internalized this problem by taking the inverse for granted; that one writes; first, and only later develops a language with which to read what was written. What would it mean to then build an institution around this idea? Such an institution would necessarily be ahistorical, and perhaps even amnesiac. It would resemble a Tower of Babel, in which each work could be understood as its own language, projecting its own art history.

Many of Yeats' finest paintings from private and public collections, including those of The National Gallery of Ireland, Crawford Art Gallery experts, his oeuvre remains largely unknown to a broader public.

In the past few years, debates around art education have experienced a gradual, yet determined drift from an interest in open formats and the emancipatory potentials of semi-institutional structures, to discussions of how those educational institutions can be optimized, or even standardized. One can easily dismiss this shift towards pragmatism for reflecting an endemic crisis of the imagination; and it probably does, but it is also a necessarily concrete response to very real threats to art education that have come in the form of severe budget cuts and sweeping measures to bring art production in line with the broader administrative mandates of research universities.

Keen on finding the missing link between Baldessari's pure beauty and Deleuze's theory of the anomalous? Or perhaps argue that Matta-Clark's building intersections can be twice as fun if you're reading an essay on MACBA's pristine building? Or maybe just create a playlist of all the MACBA's mp3 lectures you are planning to listen this weekend... Either way, when it comes to the /Itineraries/ it's really up to you to curate, collect, and provide the meta-reading on MACBA's rich digital heritage.

The orchid paintings use a variety of manipulations to achieve their effects. In /Turbulence/, /Flaming Gold/, and /Big Orchid/, a stylus was inserted into the stone patterns to create very individual images. /Chaotic Green/ made use of a small 'afro comb'. Both /Floating Pink/ and /Standing Waves/ were arrived at by use of traditional marbling combs. All of these works combine controlled rendering of the 'main' subject with the organic, fluid process of paper marbling, wherein there is limited control, not unlike the act of gardening described above.

inspiration
Looking back, it seems the men in my childhood were constantly using their hands at one skill or another, while the women made magic in the kitchen. I lived with my mother, whom I love dearly. She was a true beauty, full of life, ebullient and always tolerant of my slipping in and out of her life at breakneck speeds. When I was eight she married a Toronto fireman, Frank Nash; unfortunately we didn't get along with each other. He wanted me to be a fireman. My ambition to be an artist made it impossible for both of us. By this time it was 1943 and my father had remarried. At age twelve, I took a matriculation year at Northern Vocational High and failed. I had been a bright kid in public school, skipped grades and was a top athlete. But by age fourteen I was running away from home. I also started to get interested in the phenomenon called girls and fell desperately in love regularly, not to mention sneaking drinks out of the liquor cabinet, and spending more and more of my free time at the local restaurant hangout, Chum's, where I was a hit because I could draw caricatures of my friends. Chum's was run by a one-armed Chinese man who kept a baseball bat under the counter. We'd sneak cheap rye into our lemon cokes and dressed in black satin Eisenhower jackets with zippers from the left hip to the right shoulder. We wore ducktail hairdos and green strides with canary yellow out seams that had forty-four inch knees, thirteen-inch cuffs and drop-loop gun pockets. A long furnace chain usually hung down to the floor with a shiv on the end of it. Add to this style a Sammy Taft hat and a long black Benny overcoat and you'll recognize the period. We were walking Al Capp cartoons. And we danced almost every night. You'd find us at school tea dances, or Catholic Church dances. We'd do the dirty boogie, the Fallingbrook Balmy. We'd go out to the Canoe Club in the East End, dance, drink beer and fight over girls. I can't remember anyone ever getting really hurt.

The "narrative" of /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ is concerned with the interdependence of oppositional forms. Simultaneously rarified and stubbornly banal, the book's very materiality directs its critical force. Form and content, image and text, high culture and low: all mutually dependent terms. As staged seductions give way to real desires, so too do the worlds of art and commerce converge.

The light, and also the density of the bush where I am, is similar to Algonquin Park. I'm just fifty miles further north. I have coloured slides of the Magnetawan River, taken in steaming August, that look like the Amazon. The bush and greenery come down and overhang the large river. It's a jungle! It's difficult to walk through that bush unless you stay close to the shore. I pretend Charlie's Place belongs to me even though I'm a squatter. I fix it up and believe it's mine every year. Charlie Clifton died about fifteen years ago. His wife, Myrtle, was magnificently jovial and rotund, a five foot tall, bleached blonde from Florida. She learned all the methods of skinning animals and filleting fish from the local trappers and Indians, and taught them to me. This teaching added to the tradition wood lore I had learned from my father, establishing a kind of continuity in my life.

I avoid details showing a 'moment in time', like a bird in flight, because it trivializes the subject by placing a limit on the experience. For that reason I either play down or even banish cast shadows.

*"The Mildest of Fish"*
Lorsque je peins, je perçois de tous mes sens mon être dans le présent. Je peux dessiner n'importe quoi et le processus décompose les détails de la réalité en points discrets de couleur. Le résultat me fait réfléchir sur les limites concrètes du destin et de la désintégration corporelle.

I like the traditional format of doing watercolour sketches first, then doing an elaborated version later. This allows me to explore memory and imagination fully as it relates to the place, allows me to elaborate, simplify and anamorphisize as needed. The distortions caused by misperceptions are just as important as the raw data that one could collect by photography. Strangely enough, the finished painting feels more real than the on the spot product.

Individual Spirit in Identifying Alternative Logics and Horizons of Connectivity: The debordering and loosening of economic, sovereign, social, cultural and historic frameworks by digitization, global trade and political movements are breaking the cages of our ideological and national logics. It's time to consider the conditions in which transformative forces inspired and motivated by individual spirit are incubated on a societal, philosophical and artistic level.

Artist's page at DIAMy artwork takes a critical view of social, political and cultural issues. In my work, I deconstruct the American dream, fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and lullabies that are part of our childhood and adult culture. Having engaged subjects as diverse as the civil rights movement, southern rock music and modernist architecture, my work reproduces familiar visual signs, arranging them into new conceptually layered pieces.

The artist formalises his /Threshold/ work in three separate elements/moments.

Knowledge, or know-how with a 'k' and then no-how without the 'k.' In between these two types of know-how and no-how-- the second no-how rather influenced by Samuel Beckett-- I would want to say that there are a range of types of productions of knowledge which we might want to scrutinize and examine in terms of the courtyard.

The "Veils'" ghostly imagery takes viewers on a journey that draws from Patkin's life, which intersects with significant social and geopolitical events, including the AIDS crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As an expatriate navigating various changing cultural realities, Patkin is as wary of globalism as he is of nationalism. His works encapsulate the fleeting nature of our existence. For Patkin, we are, like his paintings, veils in a landscape, alternately hiding and revealing.

I paint 'with ( ) out ( ) words' and embrace the notion of space between 'printed words', as it Is that space which allow for more to happen. The intent focuses on that felt space where motions take note from a place beyond description.

The technical diagrams and schematic illustrations when taken apart from their sources, 'edited' and stripped of their original meaning can be seen as pure drawing or may seem to take on obscure, mysterious, or gnostic qualities. There is an awareness at work of the mutability of signs. The ambiguity of the references' symbolic value is exploited by their rearrangement within the work. In these works, rather than being decried or protested, the ambivalence and distortion of signs and symbols are accepted as given, noted in passing, and used to further the work's proposition or theme.

Elevée dans un endroit bucolique, je conserve de mon enfance des souvenirs d'une nature vierge et magnifique, qui me montrent par relation le bouleversement que le pseudo progrès a fait subir à la planète. Ces parcelles de mémoire m'incitent quelquefois à montrer deux versions d'un même paysage, l'une, celle de mes souvenirs, et l'autre, marquée par le temps, meurtrie parfois irrémédiablement. C'est le cas pour le tableau /Écologie/Désertification, séq. IV/, rappelant la dureté de la terre craquelée et, en opposition, /Écologie/Désertification, séq. V/, offrant la douceur et la poésie d'un champ de blé.

Technically, I have tried to bring a "hand painted/drawn" look to this very technical process. The image has been worked extensively for expressive purposes rather than reality issues usually attached to photography. In some of the images a state of 'creation' has been attempted in 'animating' the image.

Sometimes sublime reactions can be aroused in the viewer. Understanding what we perceive in a painting cannot be measured in space and time. The shifting representation of conventional truth resides on the surface of memory. The memory and history of perception is kept alive in the manual tracings of painting, recording the internal reality of our transient lives.

Shot in the artist's bedroom, the mise-en-scene of Brown's video is dishevelled and menacing. A shotgun can be seen hanging from a nail on the wall. A white bed, reminiscent of the one in David Lynch's/The Alphabet,/ provides a childlike eeriness. The words "Fuck You!?" are crudely written upon the grey-blue wall. The video's aesthetic is dark and hopeless, like that of Jorg Buttgereit's film /Der Todesking/, a cult masterpiece which blurs the line between art and exploitation, featuring one murder or suicide for every day of the week. Like Buttgereit's film, Brown manages to be heartfelt and beautiful as he displays a large scar near his hand ("Left wrist, age 18, suicide practice") or describes how an ash stain on his forehead was made by stabbing it with a cross made out of burnt church wood.

Textiles have long played an important economic role and still do so today with NAFTA and global markets. Textiles reflect cultural exchanges, colonial relationships, cause trade wars and labour problems, (Ned Ludd was a Lancashire weaver, who fought the use of this new machinery and left us the term 'luddite'). Crafts and contemporary weaving are often associated with 'traditions' and a romantic view of a past, lost forever. Working with ones hands holds many of the same desires associated with a desire for untainted nature. In reality, textiles have been at the forefront of technological change. My hand-woven textiles combine the technologies of ancient looms with computers – art made possible through technology.

/As substance, artistic thinking is more important than medical thinking, since art may inform and contribute to the latter, while the opposite is less likely. However, as crafts go, a surgeon is more important for society than a painter is./
With my father and his younger brother, my Uncle Harold, there was always an emphasis on the natural life, the bush, the animal world, fishing, wood lore, the ways of the Indians. The first books my father gave me were Ernest Seton Thompson books on how to survive in the bush, such as /Two Little Indians/ and /Wild Animals I Have Known/. North Toronto (Eglinton and Yonge), in what is now thick city, was surrounded by wild country. My uncle, who is also a commercial artist and a painter, made the most exquisite bows and arrows by hand. He taught me how to shoot and we'd lie in the snow with our bows for hours waiting for a rabbit to come out of its hole. There were even grouse and pheasants around then. We'd take the day's kill back to my grandfather's house and have roast pheasant for dinner. My uncle would use the quill feathers for arrow foils. There was a great sense of the land, wilderness, respect for animals, and what is now broadly referred to as eulogy.

Shine and shininess are characteristic of surface effects, of glamour and spectacle, of bling-bling contingency, of ephemeral novelty, value added, and disposable fascination. Shine is what seizes upon affect as its primary carrier to mobilize attention. Shine could be the paradoxically material base of an optical economy typically (mis)understood as being purely cognitive or immaterial. Even at an art fair or Hollywood gala, surface effects are widely deployed while being categorically condemned to the domain of inconsequential superficiality, for shine is also persistently unwilling to compromise speed for substance, surface for depth, attractiveness for soul, effect for content, projection for stasis, inflationary wealth, success, and splendor for reality.

The relation between participants and the event is the starting point for my investigation into the production of knowledge, the status of the physical body, technology and apparatuses of power. I incorporate various media including video, networked webcams, interactive websites, sound installation, text and performative strategies to design participatory events and actions. Often, the work is collaboratory, and created through a network and team of artists, computer programmers, technicians, event coordinators, and various invited and incidental participants. This network and mode of creation is as integral to the form and content of work, as is the media format used to deliver the event.

/*Trance Dance*/ The San or Bushmen, have an interesting concept of the power possessed by animals. It is called n/um and is an energy that can be beneficial or destructive to humanity if not channeled. The San perform the Trance Dance, which is a healing ritual, around a fire at night. The women sit in a circle and clap the intricate rhythms of wordless songs that are named after "strong" things like Eland or Gemsbok antelopes. The men dance in a line within the circle and alternate the vortices by changing direction. Spirit animals are attracted to the dance site. The dancers describe a boiling in their stomachs and begin to see pathways of light that lead to the spirit world. At a point some go into a trance that enables them to blend with the spirit world and in certain cases become spirit animals. This allows them to transcend physical barriers and become shamans. These healers seek the "sickness" in the other individuals, drawing it out through sites like belly buttons. Finally, they collapse exhausted and are coaxed back to life by the others through song and stroking.

This exhibition attempts to question how what we see and perceive is affected by the histories and images that live in our conscious and unconscious memories. Time and physical being are explored by Sarah Nind in paysages fragiles through a personal inventory of collected imagery, including images of environmental destruction from the artist's birth place in South-East Asia. The artist uses photographs, developed on a photo-sensitized mylar sheet (ortholith film), and painted with oil paints.

*Paulina Olowska* combines a wide variety of influences – references to modernist utopias encounter the autobiographical; Pop Art meets the visual residue of Warsaw Pact Socialism.

After a period of turmoil and loss in my life I returned to painting using free association starting with a single mark. Fresh and fun, these images are born directly from the subconscious mind. There is also one mono print which also explores spontaneity.

On the web, I am interested in obsession, poetics, identity, language, and pop-culture. Some of my work on the web is beginning to draw lines between digital and performative interactivity - web projects include an online advice lounge and an activist project advocating the 'dispersal and erradication' of English Ivy.

Ivan Grubanov (b. 1976 in Belgrade) received education at the Painting Department of the Belgrade Academy of Fine Arts, the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam, Delfina Studios in London, Casa de Velazquez in Madrid and University of Leuven – KU Leuven. Grubanov's ideas and his work achieve independence over political speech through artistic and critical interpretation of historical memory, and thus evade the unwanted banalization of artistic speech. They negate the concept of the work of art as a closed, static aesthetic object, while maintaining the identity of an autochthonous analytical and critical post-painterly practice of the open system of interpretation.represents six decades of his complex artistic oeuvre and is the most comprehensive survey exhibition to date to be devoted to the sculptor outside of his native Croatia. 
There seems a certain poignancy to me in the obviousness of my printed observation. Perhaps the awkwardness of the hand is a reminder of the feat of abstraction this simple phrase represents. Perhaps, too, I am remembering the pride she felt at the time to have achieved this level of responsibility – she who was always embarrassed not to have finished more than 10 years of formal school training.

Each viewer, of course, brings to the work his or her own set of life experiences from which to access it. None of the works are totally readable -- they are open observations rather than closed statements. I hope that they continue to reveal new levels of meaning as new experiences are brought to them.

In this issue: *Franco Berardi Bifo—The Future After the End of the Economy* <http://e-flux.com/journal/view/269> So how can semiotic labor be valued if its products are immaterial? How can the relationship between work and salary be determined? How can we measure value in terms of time if the productivity of cognitive work (creative, affective, linguistic) cannot be quantified and standardized?
In 2014, we're torn between the seductive aspect of coming together and the fear that we are consciously producing evidence that will be used against us. Let's move away from the binary logic of online/offline, of participation/exodus, and instead design other forms of social interaction and organization together, based on sustainable exchanges, strong ties, and a sensual imagination that allows us to transcend the given cultural formats (from edu-factory formats to Facebook).

In the greater view of Dominó Caníbal, a year-long project which will see another six artists intervening, destroying, resignifying and devouring the banquet that he has created here, Durham's installation and opening move in the game is like 28 double sixes or having desecrated the temple with the corpse of everything. Jimmie Durham's challenge to Cristina Lucas, The Bruce High Quality Foundation, Kendell Geers, Tania Bruguera, Rivane Neueschwander and Francis Alÿs throughout 2010 at Sala Verónicas in Murcia might well be summed up by a monstrous mandate: "Bring that stuff in Here!" Which is to say, keep on contaminating this false paradise.source: http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/kim-beoms-animalia/
I am currently designing a childrenís play area/artwork for the new Toronto airport where I have created a maze made of nylon scrim on which images of clouds have been printed. The rectangular volume is very much man-made but the translucent layers of cloud image is natureís beauty translated. At the heart of the maze is a central area where a fog machine has created a real cloud in which the children can play.

TRAGEDY

For a long time already, the two Polish artists, Pawel Althamer and Artur Zmijewski, planned a joint project which they have finally been able to realize in the Dusseldorf Kunstverein. This project was done in collaboration with the Foundation Foksal Gallery in Warsaw. As he has in his former works, Artur Zmijewski takes the position of an observer working in the field of behavioral research who provokes and studies unusual situations. Four short portrait films show Althamer in different states; the artist is a medium, mediating the intensity of his experiences or sensual perceptions. The artist's consciousness, extended through travelling, hypnosis and drugs, opens up a different, "alien" view on our direct surroundings. Banal situations are the starting point The motifs of Heike Baranowsky's video pieces are taken from everyday life – a swimmer, a cyclists, a zeppelin or grass – and that's why they seem familiar to the viewer at first sight. Through cuts and loops, however, one's perception is disturbed after watching the videos for awhile: the swimmer never takes a breath, the cyclists don't overtake one another even though they travel at different speeds.

Recently I discovered some childhood drawings: simple, crayoned patchworks that resonate deeply with my fiber work. Inspired and invigorated by a renewed sense of continuity, and awed by the mystery of how creation occurs, I am now knitting richly varied fabrics exploring many patterns, textures and colors. Once knit, the fabrics are pieced to form an always new patchwork from which I make my garments and accessories.

In this issue: ** *_Tom Holert—The Sunshine State_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-sunshine-state/> How much sun is needed to maintain or improve psychic and physical health? What are the repercussions of ripples in global energy markets on local labor politics? To what extent is the distribution of wealth related to the distribution of light? Questions of this order are placed in the folds of the narrative and the imagery of Dardenne's film, and they keep haunting the western-style tale of the heroine searching for a reason among her coworkers and within herself to stay alive in the desert of the solar-industrial real.

My artistic practice takes shape in large dimension installations, often ephemeral, and, more often than not, achieved in situ. In my installations, the onlooker is invited to experience a phantasmagorical setting, self-tinkered, obviously contrived, highly recreational, where the commonplace leads to amazement. Deliberately chosen flashy effects of mirrors, of sounds, coloured lights, stroboscopes and other eye-catching devices magnify a bewildering array of bric-a-brac arrangements; however the precariousness of the structure, or else the unbearable play of the lighting reduce the awesome sight into oblivion, like a house of cards. The figure of the castle, the archetype of " marvellous " architecture of my childhood's imaginary longings, is a recurrent theme in my work, especially the "House of Cards" (which in French is called "ch�teau de cartes", literally "Card Castle"). The House of Cards interests me for its architectural structure but also because it evokes contradictory feelings: access to an ideal world and apprehension over its impending selfdestruction.

During the period from 1985 to1986, overt symbolism was gradually replaced by an interest in perceptual distortion. The images are made from observation and found media images. But these paintings are really about space. The extreme concavical distortion of empty rooms draws the viewer into the painting. The viewer becomes Subject. The viewer's perception of the invented spatial illusion is the content of the paintings.

So why can't we then draw a direct line from its history into a present where cinema has already been weaponized as the primary technique for mobilizing vision—for drones and romantic comedies alike? From here it only takes Farocki's elegant sleight of hand to twist the apparatus back on itself, to render its own technologies of control interesting, seductive enough to be perceivable, perceivable enough to be accessible. It is through cinema that power can become fascinating in its complexity, charming in its grace, and deadly in its poetry, to the point where the spell of its technology is broken. Once the aura is gone, slippages appear at the very centers of command, where every lock can be picked and US generals fumble blindly with their own software. The technology has become impossible to master, and also available to anyone. With Harun's precise scrutiny, an intimate world of techno-social micro-machinations comes to life. When an automated gate closes and latches, Harun is there. When looking into the LCD screens replacing rearview mirrors in cars, he is there. He is there when we address a colleague at work with a certain title.

Wit is a glutton. *He is also an all-rounder – a painter and sculptor who can switch from one medium to the other with the utmost ease. A nervous chaos winds its way through his work.*

But first, how did this happen? How did a form of communication—developed in the late 1950s with a well-funded US Defense Department initiative in response to the Sputnik threat, then blossoming in the hands of engineer-entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley of the 1970s into the center of accelerated hyper-capitalism in the 1990s—evolve to become a strange hybrid of a free press, judiciary, and public market?

I originally went to Charlie's as a boy to fish the river with my parents on their holidays. It wasn't until my late teens, when I started to go away with young ladies on weekends, that I realized it might be possible to rediscover this paradise. The first art I made there was in my first notebook, a few sketches from nature. I soon began to spend every summer there, back in the bush, enjoying the company of friends like Burton, Coughtry, Markle and sculptor Nobuo Kubota.

We have a soft spot for people, for our own humanity. We learn to nurture this soft spot through art, through philosophy, through democracy, through our notions of justice or the rights of humans. We learn about the good in the things that are done by the people, for the people, through the people, in the name of the people.

The balance of the series of etchings points to the ideological productions supporting war efforts. The series is divided into various groupings beginning with: (a) diverse collections of soldiers and officers; (b) monarchs and political leaders; (c) avant-garde artists and organizations; (d) future leaders; (e) thematic groupings of war propaganda from opposing powers.

Perched above water in my studio, I look out each day at the mirror of Nature, the changing faces of weather and light, and of human works, the endless bustle of industry and traffic across the canal. No wonder that, traveling, I've been drawn most to those places where the great harbour cities open a space for the wild waters of rivers and seas, and civilize them, -- Singelgracht Canal, Rio delle Canaica, my Lachine Canal. When you've painted the waters long enough, they seep into everything: the studio floor, the still-life table, the palette of paints. You come in closer touch, too, with the Claude, Courbet and Kokoschka. The difficulties of the subject are great, but on the other hand, it's so wonderfully apt for the medium we use, fluid and willful, while pleased to offer reflection, translucency and movement.

Any object that I create could be considered a fossil. While making these works, the process of painting itself became a passageway to thought. Rendering a seamless surface from a flurry of confetti seemed to be appropriate for what I was doing. Each stroke of paint corresponded to my presence. I always felt that colour is subjective and can be applied almost randomly. Burying my renderings with layers of paint, I allude to the granular quality of the electronic media that I work with. The interface with the processor and network also made me realise that images need not be limited by edges.

Organized around the theme and title Animalia, Kim's exhibition explores the vast sphere of nature and the animal kingdom, often inverting its laws and collapsing the boundaries of living beings and inanimate objects. Refusing to accept the clear distinctions that separate realms of existence, Kim deftly employs animism, illusion and a deep sense of empathy in his works to reflect upon and transgress the social institutions that delineate natural order.re: http://www.e-flux.com/program/we-the-outsiders/

Figurative: This series made use of my long term love of drawing from the figure. I worked with the figure in a pop art style before evolving into a more expressive style where I could use my imagination. This painting is Bio-graphical, representing absence from a lover.

Each painting has its own innate practical logic that develops through a series of yes-no decisions. I lay down a ground colour. Will it be opaque? Yes? No? OK, transparent in parts then. Yes. And then it's one mark at a time. And when I am truly in attendance (which is the state I strive for at all times) I load the brush and look for the mark on the canvas. There. And there. Not there. There. Yes. Yes. No. Each mark has a reason to be there.

I see the surfaces of my paintings as hovering somewhere between skin and screen caressed by my touch but with no tracking of the hand/brush visible. The colour is purposely fake. Life has turned into 'still life' frozen on the screen, reflected in the glass, observed, recorded, transmitted, digitized. The elongated format of the paintings envelops our gaze and reflects back to the historic panoramic photos and paintings of natural wonders. Translucent shiny layers of colour act as both barriers and filters that position the viewers or spectators as the surveyors looking out from the gaps or 'windows' in the imagined viewing chambers.

By now I was sure about the significance of abstract art. Dennis Burton, Ross Mendes and I went to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and we saw our first New York originals. Burton said, 'De Kooning! You can't do that. Everything I've been taught says you can't do that.' I said, 'But Denny, he did it.' I'd never seen a Mark Rothko before except in reproductions. There was one at the end of a hall and Mendes turned to me and said, 'You know, I think I could walk up to that and put my arm into it up to the shoulder.' Those kinds of reflex actions are still valid today; they're very moving experiences. I also saw my first real Jackson Pollocks, my first Clyfford Stills, and the paintings of the great master Hans Hoffman. There was a Francis Bacon; a very good painting, quite moving, but for some reason, it didn't have that slam effect that the Americans did. Too melodramatic. The only thing it had going for it (and for his work in general to this day) is that it was nicely painted in an almost American way, but the subject matter was terribly illustrative of emotions rather than revealing the emotions themselves.

The essence of being is in the act of having compassionate understanding; a simple notion that encompasses all that is social and political within the sphere and limits of one's own environment and personal experiences.

The theme of death is experiencing a renewed vogue in popular culture. Television shows like /Six Feet Under/ and /Dead Like Me /enjoy a great deal of popularity in the Americas as well as in Europe. /CSI/ and /The First 48/ are highly popular reality TV shows (the latter featuring real corpses and real police detectives) that follow detectives as they find corpses in abandoned lots or blood-drenched apartments and process clues to solve the crime.

In /I Want to See/ (2008), Catherine Deneuve, playing herself, asks actor Rabih Mroué, also playing himself, to show her the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon war.

Certains textes peuvent être parcourus normalement et lus du début à la fin. D'autres s'apparentent au vers libre, à la poésie automatiste ou au discours fragmenté. Cette inclusion sert de relais entre la lecture normale de la peinture et une lecture où le contexte de peinture et en tension avec un matériau issu d'autres techniques. La juxtaposition du texte comme simple élément formel plutôt que pour le sens des mots, et d'autres textes qui sont de toute évidence destinés à la lecture et qui véhiculent un sens en sus de leur référents photographiques, diagrammatiques et schématiques, impose une manière différente de " lire " l'information visuelle.

My influences are first and foremost everything I see, feel and experience, but I've always loved comic books particularly work by Harvey Pekar and Robert Crumb. I love architecture particularly Art Deco. The artists I most admire are John Martin, a mezzotint artist from the 1800's, Winsor McCay a cartoonist and animator who created Little Nemo, Escher and Lyonel Feininger creator of Kinder Kids. I grew up watching films such as Metropolis, Flash Gordon, Star Wars and Brazil.So all of these things we're talking about become traveling descriptions, or like a cognitive dissident thing that ends up in a kind of binary displacement stuck between two poles.

I prefer to paint subjects on a more modest and familiar scale, weeds, rocks, trees which are found in my own backyard, 400 acres worth. When I paint small themes on a large scale, I gain rather than lose a sense of monumentality.

In his essay for the 2006 exhibition /Six Feet Under / Autopsy of Our Relationship to the Dead/, Switzerland curator Bernhard Fibicher speaks of two ways in which contemporary art deals with the subject of death: One is to reclaim rituals concerning death (which have hitherto been the realm of religion and more recently been picked up by the funeral home industry and the media) and to reinterpret, recombine and restage these rituals using the idioms of contemporary art. The other approach is to bring the corpse back to the fore in order to shock the audience with a visceral representation of death. To these two tendencies, a third can be added: the humorous sublimation of death, wherein death is turned into subject matter for comedy.

Sometimes in the places of economic cushion, emotional austerity is the norm for virtue, and waste makes ordinary action toxic and the atmosphere cortisol-cranky. I always try to remember that what we call the structural reproduction of life is about the relation of concentrations of wealth to other forms of social value and not just of who has the money.

SPECIAL: VOICE Everywhere in the visual art world, voices are rising. In the beginning they spoke about art, today they speak as art. What is the meaning of this shift away from the visual?

His fascination with the phenomena of light is related to his personal, inward search for mankind's place in the universe. Influenced by his Quaker upbringing, which he characterizes as having a ‘straightforward, strict presentation of the sublime', Turrell's art prompts greater self-awareness though a similar discipline of silent contemplation, patience, and meditation. The primary medium of Californian artist James Turrell is light. Probably the best-known artist in his field, Turrell's entire oeuvre since the 1960s has been devoted to exploring the diverse manifestations of this immaterial medium and working towards a new, space-defining form of light art. While light here refers to nothing beyond itself, it causes surface, colour and space to interact and allows viewers to immerse themselves in a mysterious, painterly world. By focussing on simple, repetitive motifs Welling sought to remove photography from its insistence on the referent in order to arrive at something approximating the ‘essence of perception.' In concert with Welling's desire to see how we see, rather than what we see his reduced yet very specific subject matter prompts a range of personal associations in the viewer.

Interior images are abstracted using decorative textures. Using my personal space I drew on raw canvas with charcoal and paint and glazing medium. These represent a happy period and a love of architectural and interior design.

The images used are often treated and manipulated using computers, color-photocopiers and other photo-mechanical techniques. They are edited, altered, distorted and have their colors shifted before being combined with drawn elements, paint and other media in the finished pieces.

None of it was intentional - it all developed and evolved over time. People always ask for my artist statement so I needed to do one but I've never liked to explain a certain piece of work - if you've made a picture and that's how you wanted it to be - hopefully it can speak for itself and whatever it says to the viewer - it's the right message because there isn't a wrong and a right message. Each person takes something a little different from the same picture and I'm happy with that.

Common to all of the new paintings is their exaggerated sense of doubleness, twoness, of the residual symmetry that appears to have existed once and then been dislocated, perhaps the function of the renegade action of the painter's taste upon the givens of geometry.

L.G.: So what do you want the outcome to be with the viewer? R.E.: I want the viewer to watch the aura that I'm giving off with the work: the sense of order, the sense of beauty in painting, the colour, the history. And to ask questions. Why is someone doing this? What is there for me to see? It's like when you meet someone you find interesting and you ask questions about them very carefully, then you start getting close to them...the work.

Exploring this theme of communications, I produced the installation /Hesitation/, which was exhibited on "The Main" or boulevard St. Laurent, which is the east-west dividing street of Montreal. It was a series of photographic signs, in the format of the traffic sign, attached to the lamp posts along each side of the street. In this show, there were approximately 20 works, extending for 4 kilometers on this main street in the city. The photographs depicted people, one of which being the artist, engaged in some form of awkward relationship. A patient expecting pain and a doctor who is preoccupied with the task; a white man and a black woman showing interest in each other, but feeling awkward at addressing their feelings; a group of young men threatening another man on the street. All of the characters are depicted having some kind of difficulty in terms of speaking their fear. They are afraid of looking stupid, or of being hurt, and they are not free.

*_Simon Sheikh—Circulation and Withdrawal, Part I: Circulation_* <http://e-flux.com/journal/circulation-and-withdrawal-part-i-circulation> But the fact that the production of a magazine is withdrawn from the public is not the same as an exit from the public sphere as such; it is not a withdrawal from and of discourse. Why, then, circulation and withdrawal? This has to do with the relation a magazine has to its objects and subjects, and how it constitutes a public as specific, and sometimes in opposition to dominant forms of publicness and official cultural policies. Sometimes withdrawal is enforced, through economy or censorship, but other times it is intentional and tactical: the withdrawal from certain public debates and arenas is what makes an alternative cultural and critical production possible.

It would appear that this ambivalent attitude to time was especially linked to the prehistoric Celtic or Gallic world, and there is further evidence that it persists to some extent in the Celtic mind today. It is consistent, I think, with Yeat's tragic view of life--an essentially cosmologic and aristocratic attitude in opposition to the narrow expediency of the "greasy till":
The artist rejects any attempt to give this drift toward anarchy and chaos any definite direction, to let it culminate in any new order. Socialism collapses. Capitalism triumphs. But the process of entropy goes on. Stilinović now demystifies money as he had earlier demystified party language. After all, money is also merely images, signs among other signs.

This is not anonymous sex. However, the photographs allow the viewer to enter the image and insert their own fantasy. I have deliberately established a female presence but kept the work open to multi-desiring viewers.

The exhibition combines archival material and examples of historic printed matter from émigré political agitators, alongside a rolling programme of documentary films; as well as exhibited video works by Adam Chodzko, Germano Facetti and Andrew Kötting.

Methodically built up and then scraped, smeared, and painted over again, the surfaces of Humphries's paintings are unstable topographies that alternately cohere and disintegrate, inviting close looking but escaping total apprehension; the viewer and painting work together in a continually unfolding experience. As a result, her works are impossible to truly see online. They demand you be here, now, with them, and that you really look.   Commissioned by YBCA, Gordon's new installation—part of her solo exhibition /It Only Happens All of the Time/—is an immersive sonic experience that emphasizes the primacy of the embodied experience; one that encourages the visitor to navigate the space through a mode of listening that is both felt and heard.  Gordon explores sound's ability to establish different levels of intimacy, and the exhibition's title points towards the ubiquitous presence of sound in that process, whether it exists at the periphery or center of our awareness. The installation's sound-absorbing walls reference the design of anechoic chambers found in military and scientific testing facilities, which insulate and absorb sound reflections. In contrast to the walls of the installation, which gestures towards a calculated experience, the sculpture /Love Seat/ situated within this contained environment suggests another, more emancipated, arrangement. Surrounded by a multi-channel speaker system distributed throughout the gallery, /Love Seat/ encourages visitors to sit and share in a listening experience with others, while maintaining a physical separation. Fostering an *Control: Technology in Culture/,/ curated by Ceci Moss, Assistant Curator of Visual Arts, is YBCA's new series of exhibitions showcasing work by emerging and mid-career artists who examine the social, cultural, and experiential implications of technology. The series seeks to prompt timely questions about the profound and far-reaching influence of technology in our daily lives by focusing on artists whose work spans a multitude of disciplines and relates to a diverse set of issues, including architecture, acoustics, psychology, labor, consumerism, the environment, and the military. and multidisciplinary practice grapples with a wide range of themes including morality, religion, sex, death, philosophy, the history of art, and consumer culture. While provocative and deliberately confrontational, their work is also deeply critical, challenging us to acknowledge what is uncomfortable and messy through irreverence and dark humour.  The overwhelming scale of these scenes is outdone only by the incredible detail and painstaking labour evident here and in other works by the Chapmans. /The Chapman Family Collection/ (2002) parodies traditional museum displays and ethnographic museal practices. This selection of bronze sculptures merges the fetishization of ethnographic objects with McDonald's characters—symbols of the commercial world—in order to reveal the underlying hypocrisy of globalization, colonialism, and commercialization. 

Original becomes dead stand in, not worth much
Repetition in architecture today, as in every other cultural sphere, attests to the historical impasse at which society has lingered for almost a century. Architects find themselves forced to recycle, reorder, and repeat novelties of the past in order to remain "cutting-edge" in the present. No longer does the steady march of technological progress provide a path for architecture to follow.  If, like me, you have experienced telepathic reception, then you know that you can never trust telepathic signals, because telepathic signals are always accompanied by something else. They are always accompanied by telepathic noise.

These paintings are about my childhood and that adult yearning to taste the sweet gummy bears of nostalgia for a time that no longer exists. These paintings are about the past, smeared with a patina of the present, trying to recreate that same feeling of promise for a utopian future.

Our understanding and appreciation of history (be it national, personal, or universal) as artists, curators, critics and art viewing audience, is complex and critical in our process of relating to the art of our time. It is this understanding that informs a wide range of attitudes about art and also influences art policy, economics, social and political thought.

Around this time I got a place of my own and worked on Yonge Street below Bloor over a second-hand shoe store. I sculpted in steel out on the roof much to the landlord's dismay and made a large mess and a small sculpture. It was the first work that I know of that was accepted into an Ontario Society of Artists exhibition at the Art Gallery of Toronto, the first piece of steel sculpture by a Canadian to be shown there. It was suspended from the ceiling. Then I started to work larger. I made a thirteen-foot fountain that actually functioned for Elise Meltzer's garden pool in Rosedale. I was sure I was a great sculptor when my fountain was installed in place of the pissing cherub. To walk into her house and almost literally trip over a Henry Moore, the first one I'd really seen, was an unforgettable experience.

The Argentinian architects Gustavo Dieguez and Lucas Gilardi, who operate the architecture firm A77, define their role as architects differently. They often attend to their building—mostly through infrastructural interventions—over long periods of time. They always return to the building process to discuss improvements with the dwellers before rebuilding or adding to the structures. On the Plaza Parque Patricios they built their wooden structure El gran Aula, which was composed of modules and embodied the idea of an "open school." Each module was used to teach something: photography, design, music, cooking. In the case of El gran Aula, the building isn't a formally defined sculpture, but rather an open framework for various forms of action, occupation, and implantation.  
Dans mes installations, je m'intéresse beaucoup à la manière dont l'œuvre est appréhendée physiquement par le spectateur pour interpeller son imaginaire. Je conçois des espaces parfois inacessibles, d'autres fois visibles seulement en partie, ou encore totalement submersifs. En effet, alors que dans certaines de mes installations (/Solipsisme/ et /Le jeu chinois/ par exemple) le visiteur s'engage dans un espace où il est submergé, dans d'autres installations il n'a accès à l'espace qu'en regardant de l'extérieur; par des hublots (/Je mens/), par le judas d'une porte qu'on ne peut ouvrir et en arrière de laquelle un son se laisse entendre (/Le bout du monde/), ou encore par l'embrasure d'une porte entrouverte (/Un château en Espagne et Encore des châteaux en Espagne/). Dans ces précédentes installations, tout n'est pas donné à voir et le visiteur est invité à avoir recours à son imagination pour appréhender l'œuvre. De manière encore plus radicale, le projet /My life without gravity/ consiste en un espace cubique fermé dont l'intérieur reste inacessible physiquement au visiteur. À l'intérieur de ce cube se trouvent des sons de feux d'artifice synchronisés à des lumières stroboscopiques, perçues à travers une constellation de trous percés à même les parois du cube. Une vidéo est projetée à proximité du cube. Sur celle-ci on me voit grimper une échelle et disparaître dans la fumée ainsi que tomber dans le vide, comme si mon corps cherchait à se projeter dans cet espace en négatif, de l'autre côté des parois du cube. /Château d'air/ est pour sa part un assemblage de seize portes noires toutes fermées, placées de manière à évoquer la forme d'un château ou d'une tour. Comme pour /My life without gravity/, on per¸oit des lumières stroboscopiques synchronisées à des sons de feux d'artifice à travers une constellation de trous, ici percés à même la surface des portes. Cet inaccessible château noir, magique et menaçant à la fois, n'est pas sans évoquer /Le château/ de Franz Kafka.

In the contemporary climate of specialization and high tech spectacle, the work I facilitate and design highlights notions of technological failure, human and electronic fragility, and the marginalized status of the physical body. The work is often exploratory and critical of ubiquitous biotechnological systems, notions of "interactivity", and network systems (socio-political and technological) as they circulate within artistic, scientific, social and cultural architectures of knowledge and modes of production. The intention is often to illuminate and re-examine the unspoken and codified social protocol, social contracts, and voices of control and agency implicit in the use, access to, and design of these technologies.

/_Death Row_/ is composed of thirteen aluminium doors with a neon light inside. This creates an optical hiatus in the space, producing an effect of corridors going through a wall.

The works presented in /DEATH... IT'S OUT THERE/ explore several aspects of death: death and violence, death and loss, death and popular culture, death and nihilism and what purportedly comes following death, the afterlife.

When I was younger, I was very upset with the ideologies of progress. I wanted to destroy them by showing that we are still primitives. I had the profound intuition that as a species, we had not evolved that much. Now I see that our belief in progress stems from our fascination with the content of consciousness. Despite appearances, our current obsession for changing the forms in which we access culture is but a manifestation of this fascination.

It has been said that we live in the age of the image, and this age is also that of the displaced image. The current ubiquity of images has led to their multiple transformations. These shifts have occurred in many ways: images move and transform between worlds, techniques, media, contexts, and cultures. They are appropriated and re-signified, while being recycled for new uses, sometimes being quite dissociated from the • A rich presentation of Cai Guo-Qiang's aesthetic iconography which is inspired by ancient mythology, military history, Taoist and Buddhist philosophy, cosmological science, pyrotechnic technology, Chinese medicine, and contemporary global conflict.

Some 30 years later, while learning to paint, I came back to this photograph. You may have noticed the lettered grid around the edges revealing the primitive system I used to enlarge the image. I no longer have that painting or even the figure of Mary, which I cut out because it was the only part of the painting I wanted to preserve. I remember keeping that canvas figure rolled up in my studio for years. But I have moved on twice since then and it seems nowhere to be found.

Indeed, it is the particular materiality of declarative shininess that we now recognize as a clear sign of paradox, as it is so often used to mediate decay and divert attention away from oncoming collapse. And as we now start to recognize how lighting effects constitute a primary function of what can only exist through mechanisms and metaphorologies of visibility, recognition, refraction, and dissemination, we might start to ask whether there is another side to shine altogether. Does shine not also serve a core planetary function of giving life to our planet, through the solar capital of the sun? We cannot afford to be idealistic here, as the sun's light and heat do not always disclose and reveal. They cannot be geo-engineered through cool roofings at will, since they're equally cruel and unstable. The sun's radiance also subtracts life—it produces famine, drought, and night.

My mother always respected my father in somewhat the same way as I did: I found him heroic, almost a mythological figure. I remember that the big pinstriped Chicago-gangster pants he used to wear always had coins jingling in them, a sound that would have been at ear level when I stood up straight.

In her series of works entitled /Irrintzi/. Repetition (2006-2008), *Itziar Okariz* explores the acoustics particular to a number of different locations, in actions that she performs and records on video. The /irrintzi/ is a system of communication at the limits of language, a traditional Basque call that the artist employs with ambivalence in her actions vis-à-vis the connotations of national identity and specific cultural forms of jubilation and exaltation on special occasions. This is the case of previous works such as /Irrintzi. Repetition 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 (2006), Irrintzi. Repetition Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2007) and Irrintzi. Repetition. Bowery, New York/ (2008) where the artist uses this cry as rough material for her performances, firstly removing it from its original context and then confronting it with new referents.

Monumentaries are historical buildings that have been purposefully altered post facto in order to influence our perception and conception of them. Any careful observer of historic buildings knows that, in order to keep them standing over the centuries, some measure of alteration is always necessary, but that doesn't make every monument a monumentary. I want to distinguish between alterations due to low-level maintenance, like replacing a couple shingles to fix a leaky roof, and alterations made for editorial reasons, like replacing a metal roof with clay shingles in order to create a more historically accurate image of the building at the moment of original construction. Only the latter type of alteration is an intentional attempt to turn the monument into a monumentary.

Some salient quotations:

You choose a path, arbitrary or perhaps the only one you're presented with and you head out only to find yourself back at the beginning, circling, repeating steps, but as the path builds, if you are watching, you see beauty at every turn. Raised crossroads, the futility of the plan.

As the cycle completes, two women hanging bat-like from the silver bridge are locked in an embrace, finding a brief moment of balance somewhere between memory and fantasy before losing it again.

A safe buoy floating above a prominent dark mauve backdrop emerges as a real existing presence and uncompromising contradiction of the visual. The object enlightens itself to be a display of a deceiving construct, revealing its true form through traces of paint. In view of this, I carry out a performative exploration of duration and its relationship to ideas of time and space through a profound investigation of painting.The image of faded middle-class "coziness" is one that lies at the heart of her photos. The result is a compelling, funny and often disturbing body of work that explores unconscious emotions, desires and sexual compulsions, all unified by an aesthetic that vacillates between the banal and the fantastic. Issues related to madness and alienation take shape, exploring feelings of anxiety, displacement and loss of identity.

What is clear in these new origin myths is that the nation as a functional structure is less and less of an actor, regressing either to a role as manager and regulator of a market economy, or as a fragmentary or backward fossil playing host to corruption and opportunism. Even today's most unapologetically authoritarian states are little more than an umbrella for the whims of an inner circle of rulers. But when faced with the question of what a state should or could be, and what its responsibilities are, we simply don't care. And yet we have to admit that when the idea of a nation breaks off from the structural base of the state, things start to get extremely weird. The nation starts to morph into a floating signifier for all manner of original communities—and can be used by original and synthetic communities alike to recompose and assemble a myth of togetherness for whatever end they please.

Developing If I Cant Dance... with De Appel makes it possible to articulate a historical context for this legacy very precisely. Established in 1975, this art centre has a rich history of showing experimental art for over thirty years and a revived interest in its programming now. Archival documentation exploring this legacy from the late 70s and early 80s will be presented. These practices provide an interesting comparison to the vernacular used by artists to think through ideas of agency, singularity and political empowerment today. A complex and fascinating mathematics of the everyday, The Knowledge involves learning 320 routes or runs mapped within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. Traveling approximately 26,000 miles across the city on Honda C90′s, knowledge students memorize a total of 30,000 streets. Calling over entails that after the completion of the days run[s], calling over as an ongoing process of repetition, memorization, rehearsal and navigation, articulated in a networked and non heirarchical manner.

*Rodríguez-Méndez *(b. 1968; As Neves, Pontevedra)  Rodríguez-Méndez is interested in sculpture, action and words as forms to be utilized to interfere in their semantics, thus creating expanded works that develop beyond the confines of their installation and form. Accordingly, he seeks to question the process of construction and delimitation of spaces and supports with these works. By employing several different languages and disciplines in his projects, unconnected from the influence of the exhibition space, he analyses the material principles intrinsic to the sculptures and to the essential and physical experience of man. He usually produces series, as repetition seems to contain all the inconsistencies of any work.

An artist's words are always to be taken cautiously. The finished work is often a stranger to, and sometimes very much at odds with what the artist felt, or wished to express when he began. At best the artist does what he can rather than what he wants to do. After the battle is over and the damage faced up to, the result may be surprisingly dull--but sometimes it is surprisingly interesting. The mountain brought forth a mouse, but the bee will create a miracle of beauty and order. Asked to enlighten us on their creative process, both would be embarrassed, and probably uninterested. The artist who discusses the so-called meaning of his work is usually describing a literary side-issue. The core of his original impulse is to be found, if at all, in the work itself. Just the same, the artist must say what he feels:

My aim as an artist is to bridge the gap between the creator and the viewer, so that the viewer becomes a collaborator in the creation of the work. Ultimately, in my curatorial practice and in my art projects, I am interested in discovering and exploring new avenues for interpersonal interactions and engagement.

Urquhart's association with Av Isaacs goes back to 1956, when he was only 22. Isaacs asked Urquhart to join his growing stable of artists, including Michael Snow, Joyce Weiland and Graham Coughtry. Two years later he embarked on the first of what would become annual, if not more frequent, sojourns to Europe, attracted to what he called the 'otherness' of the visual experiences there, especially the landscape, architecture and pilgrimage sites such as Lourdes and Vimy Ridge in France.

La deuxième occupe un espace carré au sol et est composée de trois volumes rectangulaires, alignés régulièrement à quelques centimètres les uns des autres. Ensemble, ils ne forment aussi qu'un seul volume, fragmenté. Leurs dimensions sont à peu près semblables, leurs hauteurs varient au centre, mais très peu. Les faces externes, en périphérie du volume, sont noircies et l'encadrent; les faces internes sont laissées brutes, comme les dessus, formés par stratification; un léger relief dessine, sur la surface vibrante et inégale, un frisson.

A first time collaboration between artist Fred McSherry and publisher Stéphane Danis, /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ is the most recent issue of Le muse secret, publishers of limited edition artist's books and multiples exploring the taboo themes of sex, politics and religion. Modeled on the "pillow book", an early Asian diary form, this volume combines images and texts "borrowed" from high and popular cultural sources to test the presumed autonomy of moral, economic and aesthetic value systems.

Belonging and Anonymity: The May 18 Gwangju Democratisation Movement in 1980 resulted in a massacre of the protestors by the military regime and since 1995, the Gwangju Biennale has been Asia's oldest and most prestigious biennale of contemporary art. Modern Gwangju has mostly been constructed through definitions that tend to establish specific protagonists and largely operates within the realm of grand narratives. We will look beyond such grand political and social narratives to reveal overlooked histories and traces of the lives of its inhabitants.

  Although eight months into the global economic crisis, artists, curators and art lovers from every corner of the globe are about leave some of their troubles behind and fly to Venice to look at the world's latest show—whose works have evolved from socialist realism, /thangkha/ and traditional Chinese painting to interpreting the world through popular culture, mass media and the printed word after he moved to London.

In addition to Visitor two more works will be shown. The impressive Study of my Father (2004) shows alternate images of the well-trained body of his father and photographs of demonstrations and buildings torn down by bombardments. The artist thus confronts his own origin. The video work Beauty of Believing (2005) has been commissioned by Stroom Den Haag; the temporary architecture of a stage, the carrier of either political ideologies or meaningless entertainment, forms the scenery for a meeting where commemoration and collective oblivion seem to coincide.

*Inhumanism is exactly the activation of the revisionary program of reason against the self-portrait of humanity. Once the structure and the function of commitment are genuinely understood, we see that a commitment works its way back from the future, from the collateral commitments of one's current commitment, like a corrosive revisionary acid that rushes backward in time. By eroding the anchoring link between present commitments and their past, and by seeing present commitments from the perspective of their ramifications, revision forces the updating of present commitments in a cascading fashion that spreads globally over the entire system.

His distortion and extension of the iconography of traditional carpets is a gesture symbolic of the destruction of cultural traditions in favor of progress and modernity. His understanding of the woven medium is evident, and allows him to skillfully manipulate traditional techniques and forms in carpets, sculptures and large-scale installations.

It is within the bounds of these Treaty Lands that I have lived, worked and travelled over the last eighteen years. It is these landscapes and the histories they carry which I have explored in my art over that time. The power of the Aboriginal presence in this province is great. And the level of racism and intolerance amongst non-Aboriginal peoples here is also great. It is my hope that people who see my Treaty Lands work will enjoy it for what it is, but at the same time will give some of these ideas at the very least, passing thought. And that from time to time when we step out our front doors, we will consider the notion that this is Treaty Land and what that might mean as we move through our day.

*_Anselm Franke—A Critique of Animation_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/a-critique-of-animation/> Not only is it cheaper to use real actors in motion capture than to produce characters from scratch in digital animation, it is also the way to ensure that technology today has always-already been pushed beyond the uncanny valley, because that valley itself is now bridged by the investment of life into machines.

In each of these current projects some aspect of the natural world has been brought to our attention in the form of patterns, textures or the play of wind and light. I am working to create a new vocabulary of image that marries the materials and structure of the built world with the beauty of natural elements and energy.

My initial inquiry has propelled me through long and various experiments with different media (painting with blow torch on wood, etched wax, drawings on opened burlap bags, to name some) until constructing black velvet tarpaulins with painted extraction markings or space form abstractions, some with text as space and some with timed based projections. In a serious effort to articulate cerebrally, esthetically and viscerally the results of my investigations, and in effect demonstrate with the medium - the message, I will continue to research with the following elements:

Evans achieves the daring consensus of theory and image, visual thrust and integrity of conception that has always characterized the best art of this kind.

Fred McSherry is a multi-media artist who has worked with sculpture, performance, video, installation and bookwork forms. Represented in numerous private and public collections, McSherry has exhibited his own work in solo and group exhibitions in diverse museums, galleries and cultural institutions in Canada and the USA. Over the past seven years McSherry has been building /The Virtual Library/, a collection of seventy one-of-a-kind artist's books that use the same techniques as those employed in /Charles Baudelaire Long Dong Silver and Le petit prince/ to explore the role of the book in the production of popular knowledge.

Since 1992, her research on identity has been carried out through the creation of installations where she uses material that has a link to her past and interests her today: fabric, women's clothing, wire netting and mesh, sponge, string, buttons, orange peel, etc., everyday objects that she finds among other places at Salvation Army thrift shops. Using this as her raw material, she transforms it, being inspired by the characteristic features of these materials such as their softness, weightiness, smoothness, or at times their hardness and denseness, always creating abstract objects. Her approach has similarities to that of Louise Bourgeois and Annette Messager, although both these artists work in a more narrative vein.

The exhibition features a suite of videos collaged from a collection of found audiovisual footage as well as material recently filmed by Richards. Working primarily between moving image, sound and sculpture, Richards often merges these forms within individual works to interrogate the experience of what it is to view and be viewed. This is placed in parallel with his interest in the cultural and emotional resonance of the vernacular visual content he chooses to manipulate, taken from a range of sources such as viral web video footage, mainstream cinema, experimental music and intimate video portraits of friends. Richards often integrates collaborative strategies into his work, with some of the material used in this exhibition gathered by Richards in exchange with New York based artist Steve Reinke during their residency at The Experimental Television Center (Owego, USA), whilst his events programme also includes a number of external artistic voices.

It would therefore seem that the realization of the aesthetic image or whatness of things, outside and to one side of the linear progress of time, is an essential characteristic of the art of painting and, I imagine, of art generally.

Mourning, the painful feeling that a person suffers at the loss of a loved one, is another theme addressed by contemporary art in relation to death. Juliana Schewe's video /Still /surreptitiously captures the friends and family of the artist's grandmother as they genuflect in front of the casket during her funeral.

In becoming an artist, I believe my environment mattered most: it's whom you're emulating and what you're surrounded by. I was surrounded by art. Over the mantelpiece at home I remember a large, exquisite watercolour about three feet high, absolutely naturalistic and beautifully done by my father. It was a portrait of Anna May Wong, the thirties movie star you may remember from /Shanghai Express/. My grandfather was also an artist. He painted public school rooms in Toronto, green on the bottom and cream on the top. On weekends he painted memories of English landscapes, tiny canvases with all the leaves on all the trees and all the wool on the backs of all the sheep lying where every blade of grass was clearly defined. My great grandfather was a Squire in Yorkshire, made fine furniture and painted after the style of Turner. My great uncle's paintings hung in the Royal Academy.

"The wilderness is a constant source of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration to me. I turn to these unspoiled areas for a sense of peace and solace. All of my work is dedicated to interpreting the visual harmony of our natural heritage. Printmaking, my chosen medium is very indirect and elusive. My original etchings are varying combinations of drawing, etching, aquatinting, photography, and painting. Each medium has something to say and I never know exactly what it is until I peel the print away from the plate. There are always surprises. These original intaglio prints are personal and patriotic statements celebrating one of our greatest assets: our natural environment. They portray the subtle and inspiring wilderness in less well-known areas of Canada and the United States. My work touches a common chord of familiarity amongst viewers. There is a sense of primal longings, seasonal changes, and the mystery of the wild lands we need in order to better know ourselves."

Mirroring the seven paragraphs of Cardews score, the radio piece comprises seven parts and takes place over seven weeks. In keeping with the spirit of Cardew and the political gesture of experimental composition in general, seven practitioners from varying fields and disciplines have been commissioned by Gibson and McCarthy to use and translate the score for radio according to their own personal and varying interpretations.In Kerlin's private viewing room, Byrne has built a full-scale section of a wooden roller coaster. The tracks cut through the space as though looping through the floor and re-emerging, before cutting through the back wall and disappearing off into the city. It offers a heady and vertiginous way out of the gallery, a kind-of nerve-racking adventure.

The four photographs of /El Taller/, taken in the summer of 1993, document the space of the studio in a precisely determined structure, with distinct angle shots that combine to represent a unified space, specifically work tables and a wall, against which stretched canvases are propped. These canva-ses are the very same ones upon which their own photographic images are laminated. The four dis-tinct photographs, each laminated onto a canvas of identical dimensions, were shot from slightly different positions but clearly describe a continuous space, a coherent geography of objects and architecture. This structure in itself is not necessarily significant from an interpretive point-of-view, but does involve the attentive spectator in a comprehension of the unity of the work through close observation of the photographic information. The self referencing of the photographic ‘ground' is also effected by the referencing of the tools of production (ladder, tables, stretcher bars, canvas, plier, stapler, etc.) and their relative positions in the image so that the ‘topography' of the photographic space can thus present these objects as figurative emblems that refer to a particular stage in the production process, that is, in the preparation of the canvas ground only, for in fact neither the photographic nor the painting process in itself are represented. There is an emphasis on the ground then, that draws attention to the problematic of ‘figure-ground' relations that are central to this series and all works on canvas related to it.

When media art is not generated by microchips, it grows out of the petri dish, as /AAP/ contributing editor Chin-Chin Yap discovers in the cutting-edge bio-art of *SymbioticA*. The artistic experiments at the Australian "curiosity-based, non-utilitarian" research lab in the University of Western Australia's Department of Anatomy and Human The invisible rays are described as a "medium" that penetrates objects and is revealed on screens. A floating technical surface acts as the most intimate witness of the otherwise hidden interior. An architecture is established that inverts the classical relationship between inside and outside, an architecture we still live in with our countless screens monitoring endless invisible flows. Architects, historians, and theorists quickly absorbed the new paradigm—developing an entire logic of the invisible in the early decades of the twentieth century that remains largely in place. New medical screens are today creating new forms of architecture as the relationship between inside and outside passes through another twist. New forms of intimacy are emerging. The smoothing of distinctions between humanitarianism and capitalist consumerism is typically regarded—from the perspectives of humanitarianism and capitalism alike—as "progress." As a typical claim asserts, "with significant logistical abilities, massive resources invested in R&D and highly capable personnel, many within the aid community hope that businesses can do for humanitarian aid what Amazon did for the world of retail or what Microsoft and Apple did for personal computing." But the humanitarian history of the housing question reveals that "businesses" do not only facilitate humanitarian aid, but also facilitate some of the conditions that humanitarianism responds to.  

I began making woodblock prints in 1977. In 1988/89, I began introducing woodcuts into my photo-based work. In 1992 I was one of 8 Canadian artists represented in "X Mostra da Gravura Cidade de Curitiba\Mostra Americana", at the Museu da Gravura, Curitiba, Brazil, a curated international print exhibition focusing on alternate forms of printmaking. I exhibited several multi-paneled works that combined woodcuts, photography, and light-boxes; the prints in these works expressed various ways in which the black and white woodblock could reflect photographic elements. One large work, "Machine-Gun", is in the collection of the Winnipeg Art Gallery. Over a ten year period in the 90's and early 2000's, I made and exhibited many works like this. Some of them used computers and computer-based elements. One of these was "Autobiography", the first work at the Winnipeg Art Gallery to use the web and Internet. All my work in these forms represented the fundamental premise of my work, which was the way in which different visual forms can be reflected in one another and merged into coherent works.

At that time, I lived in the Rosedale valley, with my wife and daughter. My life was like a soft-focus French film with statues leaning in greenery, trees full of raccoons and my child's record player playing jazz. I was painting all night and commercial-arting all day. I was awarded my first Canada Council grant, thanks to Harold Town's recommendation. Then a most significant change happened in my life. I'd been to Europe once before, when I was twenty, and had taken the train from Paris down to Ibiza to visit Graham Coughtry. This time I went with my wife and my daughter, Daphne, to Germany to meet my in-laws. We went to the Louvre and, via the Prado in Madrid, to Morocco. Most of the time was spent painting in a tiny house in the Balearic Islands. We lived for a year, quite well, on $2,500. Then I had to come back, give up this fantasy life, find a job, find a place to live, pay the rent and all that. By then I was spending more and more time staying up at night painting, and started to lose jobs. The truth is I started to not care about the jobs. There wasn't the slightest doubt in my mind that I was going to make it as an artist, and I was going to be a full-time professional by the time I was thirty. I wanted to be able to give up advertising art, not to have to work that way for a living. Although I had and still have the utmost respect for fine designers and illustrators, I was aware that the painting of certain artists suffered because of commercial art influences: the fashionable tricks of the hand, the clich?s. I could see it, and I didn't want it. I got out by the time I was twenty-nine. When I was thirty Robert Markle and I were approached by Dennis Burton, Robert Hedrick, and John Syme. They wanted us to teach; something I'd said I would never do, nervous that teaching would drain the energies directed toward my own work. They had started a new art school in 1965 and proposed a method of teaching that was very enticing. We were told we could teach art in any way we cared. Markle and I said we'd try it for a year. It was also additional income. After all, we hadn't much from living off freelance work.

Hand knitting started it. From the beginning the process of transforming string into cloth has struck me as magical. And, over the years, that magical process has had its way with me, leading me from hobby to art. Knitting fills me with a sense of accomplishment and integrity, and has proven a most amenable vehicle for translating inner vision to outer reality.

For us humans, ever since we started living in time, there is no such thing as real-reality; always and only fictional-reality. Nancy Huston, /The Tale-Tellers/
I am intrigued with the sensation of being personally diminished when experiencing great spaces. Deserts, mountains, and vast open plains make me feel that some fundamental truth is revealed by this sense of dissolution into these spaces. My landscape paintings are made from memory, not from on-site drawings or photographs. I use memory as a filtering agent to remove nonessential visual elements. When a work is successful, it has a poetry that presents some aspect of my understanding of who I am.

In my photographs, I hope to explore the modes of consumption common to art and the everyday, as art makers and our art-trained eyes transform refuse into something it was not meant to be.

Some texts can be scanned normally and read through from beginning to end. Others function as free verse, automatic poetry or fragmented speech. The inclusion mediates between the standard reading of a painting and one where the overall painterly context is in tension with material of a different nature. The use of text as a formal element rather than for the meaning of the words juxtaposed with texts that are pointedly intended to be read and to carry meaning along with the photographic, diagramatic and schematic referents requires another way of 'reading' visual information.

In order to stabilize power, it is absolutely necessary to keep sex cordoned off and in its place because of how it switches and mutually erases notions of emancipation and enslavement, which is after all why sexual practices and codes can be such a terrifyingly direct line to how deeply emancipation and enslavement have been inscribed into the most minute practices of a person. Just on the level of muscle movements, you can detect an emancipated citizen lapsing into the most severe or infantile brutality, and the most repressed can freely express all the tenderness that is usually systematically foreclosed in every other part of the day or in every other part of the city. Sex is where classes switch roles just for kicks and gender can forget itself. In it, you can only be a conduit for codes of submission and domination that were written into your being at some point by history, ancestry, upbringing, star sign—and even though you can never change the fact that you will always be a macho entitled fuckhead or a generous submissive who stores all that hardship on a remote server, you can rewrite yourself through role play with another person. since sexuality can never be absent from any society, sexuality is always at least latently embedded in any society as the potential for freedom—freedom from prejudices, power, control, and so forth. However, judging by statistical data, the rate of sexual intercourse under socialism may have been even higher than under capitalism.

By revisiting past "Views" exhibitions and their commissioned contributions, the invited artists will mainly focus on "updating" the pieces commissioned at that time as well as their artistic practices. This process will enable the artists to highlight the most interesting phenomena and urgent problems they deal with. /Common Affairs/ will present artistic perspectives on the shifts and changes in the Polish and the international art scene, from the "long nineties" up to the present day. It will promote positions that deal with the history and politics of memory and representation, with transformation and approaches to change.

With this work I hoped to make more complex what seemed to me a certain feminist polemic in my earlier work.

In the summer of 1989, Francis Fukuyama published his infamous essay declaring the global triumph of free-market liberal democracy over communism as the end of ideology as such. Not only that, but he also claimed the world was on the cusp of realizing what Fukuyama's mentor Alexandre Kojève called the "universal homogenous state," which would be the climax of a particular Western idealist tradition stretching back to Hegel. It would be the endpoint of a human consciousness based in accumulative historical progress that also grounded the thinking of Marx himself, who pegged his own philosophy to a conception of time and human advancement as a constant moving towards a projected endpoint. But seriously, regardless of whether this endpoint has been reached, how advanced do you really feel? How many artworks have you seen in recent years that even struck you as being relevant as art? And the insane proliferation of regressive ultranationalist and ethnic or sectarian violence hardly points to historical progress either. This phenomenon is spreading nearly everywhere, from the EU parliament elections, to India, Iraq, Hungary, Russia, Japan, and so forth. The list is endless.

In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the work of the Austrian utopian philosopher Otto Neurath (1882-1945), in fields as various as fine art, design, philosophy, cultural theory and urban studies. With the After Neurath project Stroom poses the question what Neurath, this architect of modernity, this social engineer, can teach us today. The exhibition brings together a group of artists whose work engages with the implications of the work of Neurath. They investigate the possibilities of collectively building a better future, the unification of different fields of knowledge and emancipation through organisation. Subjects closely linked to the social-democratic ideals from the past, which now, at the start of the 21st century tend to be submerged in a culture of individualism, consumerism and indifference.

If you can't see anything, you still see something ... impenetrable fog, heavy clouds, whirled up dust – white noise as an aesthetic and visual phenomena, examined and archived through a broad collection of found images. The Histrionic's line-up of vocals, guitar, bass and drums is modeled on the Australian ‘cover band' stereotype and sets out to demonstrate how second-hand mediation of international art in Australia can be a productive experience. For this CD, the Histrionics have grafted new lyrics onto faithful renditions of familiar rock/pop classics. Part critical, part ironic, these texts examine serious theoretical issues gripping the visual art world and field of culture at large. These upbeat pop renderings wade through murky political waters, dripping in controversy, innuendo and rumor. Florian Pumhosl refers to moments of early abstract and documentary image production. He not only transfers their technical and aesthetic aspects into the 21st century, but also transmits the contents of manifestos which came up together with the production of a modern picture language. Abstract films mark an important point within his exhibition. Like no other work of art they give proof of the fundamentally changed concept of the single image and the reproduction of reality.

L'identité n'est pas donnée une fois pour toute, elle se construit et se transforme tout au long de l'existence. Amin Maalouf, /Les identités meurtrières/
The post-modern world is a godless world. Humanity has become morally superior to God. God has punished his most faithful, Job, and let his son, Jesus, be brutally sacrificed, leading to the lament, "If there is a God, why is there such suffering in the world?" If God is omnipresent, then he knew that Eve would give Adam the apple and all of the subsequent suffering and punishment was essentially a set-up job by a sadistic psychopath. Of course this modern realization has more to do with the development of humanity's psyche than a free floating phantasm, surveying and manipulating our destiny. We are left alone with the human calamities of war, starvation and racial and economic slavery. We are solely responsible for the collapsing ecology and potential annihilation resulting from a nuclear accident or war. We are left with the existential realization, "What you see is what you get. If we fuck it up, we're fucked!"

Over the years this group exhibition has come to be the crowning event of the grant awards, exhibiting the works produced during this period and providing a close-up panorama of today's most cutting-edge artistic practice.

The imprisoned men were poor, mostly Eastern European immigrants carrying Austro-Hungarian citizenship, having emigrated from countries then under Austro-Hungarian rule. Many were already naturalized Canadian citizens and their sons, born on Canadian soil. They were not enemies of Allied forces. The largest group interned were Ukrainians who, 30 years earlier, were encouraged to immigrate by the same government because they were hard-working and superb farmers. Though surrounded by beauty, the internees lived under miserable conditions.

An occupation keeps people busy instead of giving them paid labor. An occupation is not hinged on any result; it has no necessary conclusion. As such, it knows no traditional alienation, nor any corresponding idea of subjectivity. An occupation doesn't necessarily assume remuneration either, since the process is thought to contain its own gratification. It has no temporal framework except the passing of time itself. arrest occupiers wearing as little as a folded bandana on the forehead, leaving little doubt about their fear of Carnival as a potent form of political protest.

Yet to continue questioning the logic of this displacement: — if photography now assumes the position of the ground of representation in the horizon of the pictorial field — what becomes of painting now that it is pushed out into the foreground as ‘figuration', but still stripped of its representational capability? A description of how this functions in the ‘abstract' segments of the canvasses of /El Taller/ follows.

Additionally, the catalogue for this exhibition, designed by Dancing Foxes Press, gathers previously published texts by Duchamp, Lucy Lippard, Joseph Kosuth, and Claire Fontaine to establish a direct relation to the process of recontextualization that the readymade engages in. Together, these artists chart our changes in perception, demonstrating that artistic practice has become notably more politicized and engaged in addressing a diversity of social, aesthetic, and temporal realities.

Features include managing editor William Pym's rumination on the 17th edition of the *Biennale of Sydney* with artistic director David Elliott, who touches on the ways that contemporary art finds beauty in our differences, and how artists' uses of irony, illusion and distance can shed light on societal inequalities. Features editor Ashley Rawlings navigates the practice of Melbourne-based artist *Brook Andrew*, a James Trainor mines the work of Jerusalem-born video artist *Omer Fast*, hailed for his investigations into the mediated experiences of film, television and narrative storytelling, and contributing editor Olivier Krischer examines the controversial career of Beijing-based artist duo *Sun Yuan and Peng Yu*.The corpse allows the artist to rescue a time undone, and at the same time mock death. In other words: the more an artist fills him/herself with death, the more he/she transcends it. Let us remember Goya drawing among the piles of shooting-squad victims at La Moncloa, Rembrandt attending autopsies to create his two anatomy paintings, David before a freshly stabbed Marat, or Caravaggio turning a dead woman fished from the Tiber River into the Dead Mother of God; or Grünewald. The Cuban people need to overcome the death taboo and face Fidel Castro's corpse—while also preparing themselves to bury his political legacy. To own this collective need to visualize a corpse could become a revitalizing imperative for Cuban art.

The extreme contrasts of light and dark evoke the sublime, but not the sublime in nature seen in the work of the 19th century painters such as Friedrich and Turner. Now that nature has been observed, measured, subjected to experiments and tabulated as part of the Enlightenment Project, it may retain its beauty but in our arrogance we assume that it has lost much of its sense of terror intrinsic to the sublime. In out ability to evoke this emotion 'god' has been replaced by man. Within the contemporary world, man's technological achievements have become the new sublime, the techno-sublime. But in assuming this role of 'god' have we become Mary Shelley's Dr Frankenstein?
This seems proof that ideas taking objective form fall under the realm of aesthetics.

I have been looking at space inside and outside and wondering why I can never see or detect space the way I perceive it in any depiction I perceive. Can space exist as a distinct entity? Can space exist outside a continuum of polarity? Can space exist as other than object and yet not be perceived as negative either quantitatively or qualitatively? Can space within space be shown? Can feminine space by virtue of its actual possession exert a vocabulary and perception imagined differently, that change ways of knowing? My intellectual interest is focused on the language and perception of space on a two dimensional plane; not illusion as in trompe l‚oeil, but as an entity in and of itself; space as force. *1* I question the vocabulary of painting, in particular, the term negative space. I suggest that extant vocabulary and therefore perception for these questions is obsolete. I also suggest that it is imperative to develop new ways of decribing what we see in order for perception to change and for understanding to evolve. Along with formal education both in Canada and New York, Freudian psychoanalysis, experience, and observation , informing my inquiry have been readings from Norman Bryson , in particular, Looking At The Overlooked, Four Essays On Still Life Painting, Sound and Symbol, by Victor Zuckerkandl, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard and writings of John Cage and Frank Stella.

*_Hito Steyerl—Beginnings_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/beginnings/> A good beginning holds a problem in its most basic form. It looks effortless, but rarely is. A good beginning requires the precision and skill to say things simply. Like the crafts of making bricks, weapons, or files on hard drives, there is an art of creating beginnings.

I did well in the art course at Northern Vocational. Robert Short was my teacher. Over the years he's been an important influence on a lot of artists who emerged from that school. He was one of the first so-called liberal art teachers in that he encouraged students to experiment. For my generation this was extremely rare. I also remember Mrs. Curry, a sculpture teacher, who was something of a tyrant. But when I got my hands into clay and started mucking around, she softened and I learned a lot from her. Rodin was a particular enthusiasm of hers at a time when the Board of Education wouldn't have approved.

Most of my work over the past ten years has dealt with the spiritual desolation of the post-modern psyche. We no longer have hope that science and technology will replace God, saving us from all ills as we did at the beginning of the 20th century. Many of us now see the ignorant misuse of our technology as the direct cause of our present global peril. My //Madonna// Series, (1979-1983), depicts the new God as Technology, and the new Mary impregnated by the mass-media, often depicted as a TV monitor, as in "The Technological Rape of the Virgin". My /Angel/ Series, (1982-1984), narrated the disembodiment of the Human Spirit, using the archaic symbol of the Angel to represent humanity's link with a higher spiritual awareness, being ignored in various familiar contemporary settings such as "Angel in the Rivoli". The /Rachel/ Series, (1984), showed a resignation to the inevitable corruption of the individual in contemporary Western society. Rachel is relentlessly pursued by animate and inanimate symbols of cultural materialism until she is ultimately overpowered and raped by the transcendental image of the Devil. The paintings that followed had no overt religious symbolism. The humanoids in the pictures had become phantoms and manikins. (/Alchemical Love/, 1985.) They were painted as empty shells caught in clich�d, mundane, staged environments. Finally, these environments became empty rooms within which inanimate objects carried only subliminal traces of their ghostly inhabitants. (/Red Interior/, 1985.) At this point the human narrative ended in my work.

I'd started to paint more and more on my own. My works were still illustrations, but they started to get expansive and more experimental. I was living alone in a studio. I had left home and had a little garret. I previously painted imitation Van Gogh's and I took my new work back to Jack Bush for critiques. I know now that the works were atrocious. Bush gave me great advice, while at the same time encouraging and confusing me. He said, 'Take a look at the work of this young guy, Tom Hodgson, and paint like that.' I said, 'I don't want to copy anybody.' He replied, 'You paint like that now, because you're not going to for long, you've got to break through; you don't know what you're doing; Tom is young, like you.' (Tom is a little older than me but not all that much, and he has kept a unique youthful vitality in his work to this day.) Bush said, 'You're a young guy, paint like you are!' So I did. I took him literally and went and checked out all the Tom Hodgson paintings that were at Roberts Gallery. I'd never met Tom; he was already a practicing designer and an illustrator. So I started to do a few 'Tom Hodgsons'.

/How do you generate a sense of responsibility? What is the response today to a request that we are responsible towards another or towards their different world-view? How could we act differently in the roles of producers and/or consumers of culture? What are the ways of playing a more active role in this process?/
/*THE CIRCLE OF HISTORY*/ Paintings by Gyula Kalko   	/Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity./                 W.B. Yeats, 1939.

Farocki's last work looked at the design of worlds within video games. If we understand the history of cinema as also being the history of optics, then what are the physics of a world made out of vision, of a living cinema? In gamespace there is always a problem when you try to leave, when you reach the edge of the world and you try to go past it, to exit completely. And in Farocki's /Parallel I–IV/, the moment you reach the edge, you hit a transparent border. Even if you fall through past the limit, the film loop starts again and you are urged to return.

When I was a child, there were creative people in my family: a great aunt who painted pottery; my mother who did little watercolours under instruction at school and my father who was a photographer at one time, and serious about his work. But I never had a relative who was an artist /per se/. Actually, my grandmother was quite a strong influence throughout my life. She was an artist in the sense that she liked landscaping the grounds of our house, which were considerable, given the fact that we lived in the centre of the town of Niagara Falls on half an acre. She had ponds made; there was a wood; there was an old barn in the back of the house. It was like an oasis of quiet

For the Venice show, Iván Navarro has created a group of works in a socio-political perspective – a theme woven into all his work.

His extraordinary oeuvre stands out for its diversity and individuality: It embraces performance, film, recording, painting, visually-presented aphorisms and texts. For his critical exploration of the images of Western culture conveyed by the media he drew on techniques and images from the culture industry and advertising. For documenta 7 Goldstein wrote an aphoristic essay for the catalog, which begins with the assertion that "media is sensational". This sentiment runs like a red thread through his work and is specifically a leitmotif of his paintings. In the 1980s Goldstein was considered one of the most promising artists of the Post-Pop Art movement alongside Richard Prince, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and David Salle. Working in New York from the 1950s until his death in 1989, Smith unequivocally resisted and upturned accepted conventions, whether artistic, moral or legal. Irreverent in tone and delirious in effect, Smith's films, such as the notorious /Flaming Creatures/ (1963), are both wildly camp and subtly polemical. Smith is best known for his contributions to underground cinema but his influence extends across performance art, photography and experimental theatre.

by the weightless flat screens now commonly used for advertising in metropolitan high streets. Juxtaposing his personal and highly expressive methodology for composing moving image within a framework more familiar to technological advertising space, Richards seeks to understand our quotidian experiences of digital advertising as engaging an emotional and complex set of relations between audience and images.

Marman and Borins are known for their ability to creatively produce refined multimedia installations that are well-crafted, intricate and large scale. They have a diverse vocabulary that employs industrial and non-traditional materials and they are known and respected for their innovative approaches to sculpture.

Every year, the exhibition calendar of the Botín Foundation opens with this joint exhibition, where the use by the artists of these nine months of intense creativity is assessed, showcasing a faithful view of their latest artistic proposals. A diversity of origins, work places, techniques, and concerns come together at the youngest and freshest offering displayed in the exhibition halls of the Botín Foundation. 
I wouldn't call what I do 'realistic' but something more like 'believable'. An intimate engagement with what I paint is essential. Even in non-landscape pieces like the still life in my show, I required intimacy with my subject. The art and books depicted are from my own collection. If I didn't actually own these pieces, but just copied them from an art book, it would have been an empty exercise. The collecting of the objects was part of the art-making process, many years in the making.

heteronymous signs. For Reza Negarestani, philosophy can break this stranglehold of heteronymy through its programmatic and functionalist deployment of thought and thinking as an already autonomous enterprise. By establishing and structuring realizable commitments towards their own ends and demands, philosophy still has the capacity to release a full-blown project of emancipation via the extreme rationality of thought's computability and capacity for abstraction. For Negarestani, thought itself is an ancient artificial intelligence whose resilience stems from its artificial capacity to reinvent itself. —Julieta Aranda, Brian Kuan Wood, Anton Vidokle

The exhibition, which is the first major survey of Yeats work to take place in Ireland in almost forty years, compares his work of the 1920s, when he was firmly rooted in reality, with the wildly apocalyptic visions and romanticism of his later period.

La troisième occupe un espace irrégulier et vague au sol, et est composée de cinq éléments plutôt courbes, bombés, qui semblent s'être en partie affaissés les uns sur les autres. Ils pourraient être issus d'un seul volume, éclaté. Les faces externes sont texturées, rugueuses et sombres, les faces internes lisses et pâles; les tranches sont brutes et laissent évident leur mode de construction. Les cinq sont de dimensions à peu près semblables, mais leurs orientations varient. Près de la première et de la deuxième sculpture, la troisième semble un peu délinquante, une inversion.

These landscapes were made to be decorative but taken from reality. Surface forms are flattened, using paint stains that soaked into the canvas. The colour is arbitrary. These painting were done after the death of my mother and so include skeletal forms. My feeling then was that all of life has an underlying layer of suffering and death.

*_Anna Tzini—The Opacity of Queer Languages_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-opacity-of-queer-language-2> Queer slangs are full of irony on several different levels that are recognized by all, but only meant for some. Often the same (ironic) phrase can have different groups laughing for reasons that are not only different, but also politically oppositional, producing a third layer of humor for those who understand both meanings and can see how others are laughing at something that could be read against themselves, but without having the faintest idea.

I don't set out to produce art about one subject or another. I'm never without a sketchbook to hand so I am constantly drawing and sometimes the drawings are left in the sketchbook and other times they develop into more in-depth ideas and detailed images.

Thinking of how to make all these concepts more effective, I would suggest the idea of the "Intervenor": an autonomous outside voice who nonetheless has the right to act within the institution. Intervenors could not only act within the walls of the white cube, but could also directly intercede when it comes to matters of communication, events, bureaucracy, administration, and even the office space itself.

Elsewhere in features, managing editor William Pym reappraises the controversial Indigenous Australian painter and video artist *Richard Bell* and his alter ego, "Richie," while editor-at-large HG Masters gets together with Tel Aviv's *Sigalit Landau*, just prior to the announcement that she will represent Israel at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Masters considers Landau's predilection for the "morbid, masochistic and postapocalpytic," and anticipates the shape her work might take in the unfortunate event of a second Gaza War.

The Crimes Against Animality Series are monumental Social Conscience paintings that explore human and animal histories. Ambient soundtracks are created in Garageband using my voice and other sound effects. Ultrasound directional speakers transmit the sound in a narrow 1-foot beam. 'Xenotransplant', (2011) references failed experiments to farm interspecies organs. Genetically modified pig organs were grafted onto baboons, who host the organs until transplantation into humans. The soundtrack consists of interior body sounds overlaid with conversation about the experiment and baboons (Quicktime 49min available on my website using Safari). Additional subjects in this series include shark finning, fracking, Aversion Therapy, female genital mutilation, farm animal exploitation, genetically modified food, rhino horn trade and other topics of concern.

Faisal Anwar's video /As Simple As That?/ deals with this issue of violence from a different perspective. The work was created post-9/11 in Pakistan at a time characterized by the artist as rife with global tension and strained Indian and Pakistani relations. Shot in the city of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, at a butcher's home where people go to procure meat for their family meals, the video documents the killing of a baby goat and uses this killing as a metaphor for what we are doing to each other around the world. The title /As Simple As That? /refers to the fact that things are not so simple, and it directs the viewer not to take what they are about to see as mere sensationalism.

In 1956 the movie Lust for Life with Anthony Quinn and Kirk Douglas came out. Moulin Rouge had appeared before it in 1952. This had to be it. If you're a commercial artist you've got deadlines; it was the day of the grey flannel suit. I was still working at commercial art, doing more design, layout, lettering, developing a cartoon style for TV animation. But I realized that I wanted to do more insane things than applied art allowed. I'd never really got along with the bosses. I never really liked getting up early in the morning. I never liked deadlines. So I began the syndrome of painting into the early morning hours. Because of Life magazine Bernard Buffet was a hit. It was easy to emulate that stuff.

The Anthropocene is "the age of man" that announces its own extinction. In other words, the Anthropocene thesis posits "man" as the end of its own destiny. Therefore, while the Anthropocene narrative keeps "man" at its very center, it marks the death of the posthuman and of antihumanism, because there can be no redeeming critical antihumanist or posthuman figure in which either metaphysics or technological and scientific advances would find a way to reconcile human life with ecology. In short, /images/ of the Anthropocene are missing. 

Above it all, Levy remains fully aware of the power of his own objects. His criticism of the art-world lies in their tendency to get lost in art-historical references and comparisons rather than celebrating the pure creation and endurance of the solid objects.

/*Origins*/ I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1958 and lived through the Apartheid era. Because of this my art tends to be socialist. I relocated to Toronto, Canada in 2005.

For the past three years, Katja Jacobs has been exploring images and memories from her past, using them as a point of departure for what I regard as some of her most provocative and engaging work to date. The project began as a series works on paper, but now includes a number canvases. Jacobs incorporates specific images of places and people crucial to her history, transforming them and often concealing them with layers of "text" that blur the distinction between drawing and writing. At times, we can read phrases, words, fragments of sentences, while at others, known alphabets and language dissolve into graphic abstraction. The series employs literal collage, as well as visual palimpsest, with layers often stitched together to create yet another kind of intensely physical "drawing." This powerful physically is further expressed by the rich variety of materials, from graphite and paper to cloth and wax, used to suggest surfaces transformed by the passage of time.

In the lead-up to major cultural events including the Shanghai Expo and the Biennale of Sydney, /ArtAsiaPacific/ adopts an optimistic view of the future in our May/June issue. Inspired by the mission of the World's Fair to promote cross-cultural gatherings not as contests but as opportunities for human advancement through the exchange of ideas, we explore how artists pursue aesthetics and politics in the hope of seeing their way through a world that is both dizzy with change and mired in old fears and assumptions.

The exhibition includes documentarian approaches, such as works by Julia *Christensen*, who explores the transformation of defunct Big Box stores throughout the U.S. as an example of the resilience and resourcefulness of those affected most by the crisis. A piece by Yevgeniy *Fiks*, Olga *Kopenkina*, and Alexandra *Lerman*, documents those who were at the root of the crisis (Wall Street traders and corporate employees) participating in discussions on Lenin and his ideas on Imperialism. Films by Jan Peter *Hammer* and Melanie *Gilligan* reflect the artists' fictionalized takes on the crisis, by drawing historical paralells and showing the microcosmic point of view of those directly involved, respectively.

The power of restructuring inherent in the process of deconstructing the past, the curator believes, is enormous and irresistible and is seen almost more as a taboo that should be resisted and one we should oppose. *GO INSIDE*, emphasizing the connections between manifestations of the present both with history and with local conditions, comprises sculpture, installations, projections and sound projects.

Each project often consists of multiple works, often in a range of different media, grouped around specific themes and meanings. During research and production new areas of interest arise and lead to the next body of work.

I was born in 1957 and raised in North York, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, where I began painting at the age of 13. My allied activities at this time were geology, chemistry and natural science. My interest in nature was more toward the experience, rather than understanding it. Exploring and experiencing the city ravines directly influenced me to become an artist. As this landscape did not include panoramic views, such as landscapes or forest interiors, weeds and rocks, this approach has remained with me throughout the years and only recently have I begun to paint skies, a much broader subject.

I'd like to think of my new work as documenting the art world at a time when it is has reached a peak in its production of sheer materiality, with its crowded art schools and overflowing biennials, art fairs and hedge-fund collections.

Jalal Toufic is a thinker whose influence in the Beirut artistic community over the past two decades has been immense—notwithstanding that, as he put it, many, if not all of his books, most of which were published by Forthcoming Books, "continue to be forthcoming even after their publication." In relation to one of these books, he wondered: "Does not a book titled /Forthcoming/ suggest, ostensibly paradoxically, a second edition?" Here's the revised edition of/Forthcoming/, a book first published nearly a decade and a half ago by Atelos press.

When ideas thumble from our mouth, the better explained, the easier to understand.

The new Intuit Series paintings explore a hybrid figural abstraction. The titles are verbs implying action as a process of becoming. I have been influenced by David Bohm's concept of Implicate Order, where everything is interconnected and enfolded within, thus bypassing the particle/wave dilemma. 'Impregnate' is a poetic evocation of that process. 'Exfoliate' is a gut response to the brutal skinning alive of cats and dogs for their pelts. 'Cybernate' references the cybernetics of Gregory Bateson, which addresses the structural patterns in all living systems. 'Operate' is a 'portrait' of my friend, Diane Victor, a great South African artist, who has polycystic kidney disease and urgently requires a kidney transplant.

The Management

Yet the field of art is not set up to deal with these administrative challenges, for it refuses to offer a definitive answer to the question of what it is actually doing: the question "What is art?" must be left open. The more important and interesting question then concerns not the prudishness of this refusal, but the fact that the most useful answers are always provided in the negative. These are the answers that account for the fact that art education is, in fact, a fundamental paradox; almost a contradiction in terms. For how can we even begin to think about teaching something that, on a basic level, cannot be taught? How to form the audacity to make moves that have not been already sanctioned, and within spaces where they may not be acceptable? Fostering this audacity is less a structural concern; of how to deal with a given space, of how to access a history or a network of relations, of how to make work visible, and so forth—and more a question of identifying the kind of thinking that can surpass structures and institutionalization altogether. We might call this artistic thinking.

Fundamental changes have a rhythm with which mankind has become familiar over the ages. Man gradually adapts. By accident man invented history; he wrote in the style of inventory and visualized his histories through art. He accumulated, incorporated and orchestrated. His world became regular and predictable.

The focus of what I have included reflects my involvement with the complexity regarding inter-personal relationships in our societies. In 1979 I accompanied my mother who had been asked to appear as a witness in a War Crimes Trial in Düsseldorf, Germany. After going through this experience with her my work over the next few years evolved into an exploration of anti-Semitism and Holocaust. How people inter-relate in our societies became focused on the Jewish experience as I saw it through my family's history.

Considering the fact that I was born deaf, my learning process is shaped by American Sign Language interpreters, subtitles on television, written conversations on paper, emails, and text messages. These communication modes have often conveyed, filtered, and limited information, which naturally leads to a loss of content and a delay in communication. Thus, my understanding of reality is filtered, and potentially distorted. This is part of the core of my practice as an artist and I am now taking ownership of sounds after years of speech therapy. Instead of seeking for one's approval to make "correct" sounds, I perform, vocalize, and/or visually translate them based on my perception.

Although abstract art is sometimes criticized as being purely formal and lacking content, it remains for me a vital and sensory art form. I do not believe that form can exist without association or ideological content. Without inventive and unified form there is no art at all. Quality has never been dependant on stylistic orientation, figuration or abstraction. Goya, Manet, Matisse, Leger, Miro, Hoffman and Pollock are all quite different, but all made their art by formal, expressive and original means. I intend to continue this challenge.

In my research on Yves Klein, I was taken up by his persona of the Dandy; he'd moved the legacy of Beau Brummel to the 20th Century. I was quite envious of the younger male painters in my milieu who seemed able to take up abstract painting without a qualm. Dandies themselves, they smartly took up a critique of the monochrome, weaving in references to pop culture, while making attractive, decorative work. They got to have their cake and eat it too. I'd trained as a formalist fifteen years earlier, but in the heady 80's had eschewed a conservative practice that didn't take up the political. Ever the whiney feminist, somehow I'd missed the boat.

Painting is a perceptually abstract construction. Paintings are visible as translations of sensory memory within the biological structure of the brain. But they are viewed and reconstructed in the mind's eye. Painting's sensual quality of colour and tactility act as emotional transmitters, re-attaching our isolated psyches to the spiritual identity of our species.

It must be emphasized that these ruminations on tobacco (and by extension and association alcohol) – the lure of the delicious – of abiding friendships and fertile reveries - must come with advice and a caveat, don't drink and don't smoke. It's bad for your health.

Transit stations have the potential for the kind of interactive environments that I enjoy creating as the traffic flow determines the experience of the work in potentially interesting ways.

These paintings want to move. Their rhythm is that of theAM radio. They shake and jiggle and they can't keep their legs still. They chug and clank like the trains on the railway tracks of my youth. They spin quietly like the inner workings of a wrist watch. They're Professor Longhair and Hank Williams talkin' bout the latest Beach Boys record. They are the colour of billboards, shopping bags and old factories. They are the colour of pop cans and plastic shoes. Floating on the surface are the leftover bits of shapes, carved out by my brush - like pop ups on a computer screen, like the flotsam and jetsam of old sputniks and appolos coursing through space. They're constantly squabbling. The ordered and the messy jostling for supremacy. These paintings are like siblings stuck in the back seat on a long summer drive: They draw invisible lines, defining impervious boundaries between each other, broached easily by wandering fingers.

/*Telling Stories*/ The Primal stories delve into the underbelly of society, exposing taboos and crossing boundaries. The point of bringing these hidden aspects into view is to re examine outmoded ways of thinking in an effort to permit new vision. It is a process of un-censoring.

Something else also happened around the time of Fukuyama's proclamation. Because another side of the end of history might have to do not only with the collapse of a certain notion of humanist progress but also with a whole other shift in temporality that made it doubly unsustainable. And it also took its structure from the liberal tradition as well as the US military. It has to do with radical advances in communication technologies that we also call the internet. In fact, Fukuyama's mistake may have been in seeing a global Pax Americana in traditional geopolitical terms, when in fact the end of history is then not only the end of a certain era of political thought but also the beginning of a new phase of extreme spatial and temporal compression. It is marked by a perpetual sense of dislocation that alters the way we experience places and events, and by extension the way time and causality function—certainly not in terms of any accumulative continuity that would make historicization possible. Instead, everything happens as if simultaneously, even contemporaneously. We thought Fukuyama was talking about ideology, but it was also about how we stabilize an idea of one thing following another in the most basic sense.

Platinum prints are not only the most permanent and stable of any medium on paper, they are perhaps the most exquisite as well. Nothing else looks like a platinum image. No other photographic process can achieve the ethereal luminosity and three dimensional appearance of the platinum photograph. Platinum is one of the most inert elements know to man, even more stable than gold. A platinum print is in fact as permanent as the paper it is printed on.

/POWER STATION takes the form of public intervention, highlighting contemporary influences, beliefs, pre/misconceptions and belonging. Power, in various forms extends its influence to our daily lives yet our notion of power and its extent of influence is often, perhaps deliberately, overlooked. The project challenges our understanding of identity in relation to authority, nation-hood and globalisation. Moving and interacting within/outside centres of power, be it cultural, political or financial, POWER STATION aptly questions their authority and invites reflexivity yet inevitably becoming an accomplice to these power games./
The gallery supports the creative work of independent curators. Curators build the frame work in which we understand artists and the art they make. At their best, they redefine how we look at culture.

In a later series of photographs, titled Natural Law, I examine the inherent futility of demarcating space: smoke stacks and tree branches vie for attention; a tree obscures a flashy Schneider's meat billboard, and road kill on a freshly sodden grassy slope suggest that natural selection acts indiscriminately of artificially imposed boundaries. Despite extensive infrastructure, "maintenance free" materials, sturdy fencing, and billboards marking industrial progress, the principle of Natural Law exposes the irony of ownership, as the landscape inevitably surmounts artificially imposed perimeters.

Thérèse Joyce-Gagnon, RCA
In No Fixed Address and Paint Palettes, I examine how ornament and decoration are used to delineate space and assert autonomy. For No Fixed Address, I photographed the front doors and entrances of 25 subdivision homes on a suburban street in Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The structure of each home is strikingly similar in design, and each doorway is flanked by a set of nearly identical pillars. To offset the architectural sameness, many home owners have made a variety of superficial changes. Some front entrances have been renovated; others are replete with flower pots, elaborate entrance hardware, a wide range of concrete and flagstone steps, wreaths, seasonal ornaments and decorative mailboxes. Although the monotony of the 100 photographs is striking, the subtle "home improvements" become important signifiers of an attempt at demarcation.

The images for my weavings were created in 'Photoshop' from various sources, including scans from real plants and books, digital photographs and images from websites. Then, the colours were reduced and translated into weave structures, using 'JacqCAD' or 'Pointcarr�' software (industrial Jacquard weaving softwares). The resulting file, containing only black and white information was then uploaded to a computerized Jacquard loom in Montreal at the Centre de Textile Contemporain de Montreal, where I wove initial tests and pieces by hand. Some pieces were also woven by a technician, from files I sent via the Internet.

I think it's our job as artists and intellectuals to be out in front of things, like canaries in mineshafts, and to be looking for things which are there to be sensed, like a tingling and hopefully collective Spidey-sense, but which might not yet be there to be measured. Something more like "structures of feeling," or things that are in the air, which might have some other kind of impact, some immeasurable impact.

survival, and you can call it resistance. Small islands of temporary social autonomy will resist, but the conditions for social solidarity have been cancelled by the pervading precarity. We should stop deceiving ourselves: the only resistance to global financial capitalism for the time being is the identitarian force of localism, identity, and fascism.

Conjointement à ma pratique installative, j'ai une pratique soutenue du dessin. À l'origine simples esquisses pour des installations futures, le dessin est devenu avec les années une pratique autonome qui se nourrit des mêmes préoccupations que ma pratique installative. Je réalise des dessins de grands formats qui évoquent des paysages imaginaires labyrintiques dans lesquels le regard est invité à se perdre. Comme dans Les villes invisibles de Italo Calvino où, dans une entente tacite entre le narrateur et le sultan, ce dernier se délecte d'une vision idéalisée de son empire, ces espaces irréels m'intéressent en ce qu'ils s'entichent d'une vision idéalisée du monde où le désir et la fabulation triomphent sur la réalité et la vraisemblance. Mes dessins sont composés de motifs s'amalgamant les uns sur les autres de manière à former des paysages artificiels où montagnes abruptes, tapis volants, cieux étoilés, volcans et châteaux deviennent des figures récurrentes.

Impressionism has its limitations. The concern about accurate depiction is there, but it must give way to the needs of good 'picture making' and good 'paint pushing'. I want to find a middle ground between realism and abstraction, using no more of either than necessary.

Whatever the theoretical presuppositions Evans brings to his practice, the methodological constraints he imposes upon it, or the perceptual and arithmetical rationale he uses in making paintings, the fact remains that his final concern is with the observer approaching the painting simply as an object: a peculiarly loaded object to be sure, but an object nonetheless, and one that yields its secrets only in our experiencing of it.

Lecture by Paola Pivi
My father used to work at home in the evenings. There was a tilt drawing table in the kitchen. It was as much a part of the furniture as the chesterfield suite that he designed. In fact, my father designed much of the furniture in the apartment.

I feel that representational painting has much yet to offer -- if not in terms of how we paint then certainly in terms of why we paint.

he "unbounded world" does not pertain to some return to "nature," but is the effect of a particular institutional regime that regards any limit as potentially already outmoded. Far removed from the model of a central power directly controlling subjects, the performance/pleasure apparatus is apportioned into diversified mechanisms of control, evaluation, and incentivization and pertains to all the cogs of production, all modes of consumption, and all forms of social relations. One common explanation for why intellectual property makes no sense in an era of file-sharing uses the example of what happens when you copy a file on a computer. Copy-Paste: a second file has been produced, but the original is unaltered. Now it has a sibling, a partner, a twin. And if they keep reproducing themselves in this way, no problem. Which is to say that, at least in the digital domain, the entire calculus of scarcity is very different from the material domain. The difference between a single entity, two entities, or a billion is almost nil. Under these circumstances, as the argument goes, reintroducing laws of scarcity by limiting access is simply backward.

However, at the heart of all discussions on arts funding, whether it comes from Hanoi or Hollywood, is the reality that the ever-growing art world navigates the same choppy financial waters. Let's hope that artists, curators and patrons—whether they are heading for Venice or working in their studios in Karachi and Korea—remain undeterred by such challenges.

/Painting is What I do, Nature is What I Like/ An Intimate Approach to Landscape
The eight paintings are installed at varying angles and heights, animating the whole of the wall. As monochromes they evoke the Ellsworth Kelly installation at the National Gallery in Washington, DC, "Color Panels for a Large Wall" (c.1978). However, their diagonal composition denies the flatness of that modernist grid. The landscapes themselves recall motifs found in wallpaper or brocade, suggesting that the solemnity of the monochrome might be the decorative in disguise.

*_Raqs Media Collective—Planktons in the Sea: A Few Questions Regarding the Qualities of Time_* <http://e-flux.com/journal/view/243> Our mortality should be the gold standard of our life's transactions with other lives. It is the metal to which we can peg all our currencies, all our instances of giving and taking to each other. Once we die, we can neither give nor receive, and all attempts to evade this fact, whether through inheritances or estates, are basically arbitrary attempts to pretend that death had in fact not occurred.

*_Adrian Rifkin—Yes, That's What I think_* <http://www.e-flux.com/journal/yes-thats-what-i-think/> Stricken almost speechless, my friend managed to say only, "Hello, big, isn't it?" To which the tutor replied, "Yes, and shiny too," and passed on without more than a glance at the supposed masterpiece. Was it a judgment on my friend's simplemindedness, or maybe on his incapacity even to have registered the shine? Or on the painting that was thus relegated to some storeroom of Adornian kitsch, even disqualified and misattributed, precisely on account of its shine, its over-varnish? A Caravaggio, even?

Working with clay influences the printmaking, encouraging a sculptural approach. The plates composed of stitched and reconstructed industrial roofing copper gives a second reading of strength and organic tracings embossed into the paper, reaffirming perceptions of fragility and transience.

On the one hand, following from Camnitzer, granting the artist a position that precedes language (and, by extension, history), while opening a large space for experimentation, could be seen as a tediously romantic endorsement of the artist as mad genius; unaccountable and unaware of the vocabularies that have consolidated around him or her. But would this not be another way of describing an already-existing hysteria embedded in a field where all legitimating mechanisms are subject to highly contingent and subjective impressions and projections of value and importance? While we could say that a vocabulary exists for linking these together, it still does not manage to form a coherent language of judgment, of totalizing denouncement or terms that could otherwise measure the definitive success or failure of a work of art. This could be the source of a good amount of psychosis, but it would be even more insane to suggest that a central authority /should/ form a central criterion of aesthetic judgment as a template for all. And anyhow, art at its best does not provide answers and solutions; it creates problems. I wondered whether I could devise a system that would turn this on its head. Instead of having a secrecy haven, we could have an openness haven./
The end of the Cold War failed to bring about the end of history as the liberal world order, and liberal democracies have failed to reign in the excesses and instabilities of global capitalist markets and to rid the new world order of primitive ideologies and political enmities. The threats to "forms of life," to the will to life, continue to exist. Stateless people and groups are exceptionally vulnerable to "disappearing." There can be no effective movement for collective self-preservation without the proper political determination.

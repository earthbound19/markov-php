# DESCRIPTION
A very simple Markov chain text generator, which means that you can feed it a source text (or corpus) and it will generate statistically similar but wholly different gibberish "sentences" composing one or more paragraphs (perhaps to be called a corpse, the result of carefully butchering the input).

# USAGE
Coded in php; upload the files and folders in this repository to your own web server and navigate to the page to use it.

# DETAILS
This is a forked and only slightly tweaked to generate International Art English (IAE, for example, hifalutin and pretentious "Artist Statements--" see https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english), by Richard Alexander Hall, http://earthbound.io -- using a corpus of IAE which I assembled from many sources. I will likely periodically add to the corpus, so that it will produce more realistic output over time.
